# Detailed Analysis on Delegation of Powers in accordance with Municipal Regulations 



The Commissioner does not need to be solely responsible for all the powers or functions granted to him by these Regulations unless his special permission is specifically required. This stipulation means that the Commissioner has the capacity to delegate these powers to any municipal official under his control, albeit with the option for revision if the circumstance demands it. Moreover, any conditions or limitations prescribed by the Commissioner will govern this delegation. 



This delegation structure is embedded in each of the municipal Regulations. For the purposes of understanding these Regulations, whenever the term Commissioner appears, it should also be understood to include any municipal official to which powers have been delegated. As such, these municipal officials, once endowed with these powers, should be treated as Commissioner within the scope of their delegated authority. 



In essence, this setup enhances administrative efficiency in the execution of municipal duties and ensures adherence to conditions and limitations deemed necessary by the Commissioner for proper governance.


# Regulations and Discretionary Powers of the Municipal Commissioner



In alignment with the spirit and intent of these regulations, the Municipal Commissioner possesses discretionary powers which include the following:



1) The Municipal Commissioner may revise zone boundaries if the zone's boundary line divides a plot, village boundary, or a CS/CTS Number as stated in the revenue records. This zone boundary modification requires his/her special authorization.



2) The Municipal Commissioner may determine the usage of premises for public utility purposes by public service organizations, government entities, semi-government entities, and local bodies. This authority can be exercised irrespective of prevailing land use classifications/zones, provided such usage is deemed beneficial for public convenience and welfare, and this again requires his/her special authorization.



3) The Municipal Commissioner may adjudicate matters that allege errors in orders, decisions, requirements or interpretations made by municipal officers under delegated powers, particularly in relation to the application and interpretation of these regulations.



4) The Municipal Commissioner may interpret these regulations when the actual street layout on ground contradicts the layout illustrated in the development plan.



5) In exceptional cases where a clear hardship is evident, the Municipal Commissioner, explaining his decision in writing, can permit modifications to various dimensions detailed in these regulations. This permission covers all dimensions barring those relating to floor space indices, except where otherwise permitted under these regulations and on the condition that public and structural safety are not compromised.



6) Any discrepancies or errors concerning location, size, usage of designations, approved relocations of reservations not reflected in the Development Plan, and brought to MCGM's attention, after due scrutiny, can be corrected with the special permission of the Commissioner. 



The Municipal Commissioner should issue a well-reasoned order explaining corrections, including an authenticated part of the plan showing the corrected location bearing his seal and signature.

# Regulatory Scheme 9: Development Permission and Commencement Certificate Requirements for Infrastructure Projects



The necessity to obtain development permission and a commencement certificate for building activities is unequivocally stated under Regulatory Scheme 9. This regulation clearly states that nobody may erect, re-erect, modify, or undertake any sort of developmental or redevelopment initiatives on any plot of land without procuring the requisite development permission as well as a commencement certificate from the Commissioner.



There are specific types of operational constructions excluded from these regulations, they include works undertaken by organisations like Railways, National Highways, National Waterways, Major ports, Aerodromes and Airports, Posts and Telegraphs, Telephones, Television, Wireless, Broadcasting authorities and similar communication firms. Also included are regional grid projects including towers, switchyards, control room, and relay rooms for electricity distribution, Defence Authorities and any other public services deemed essential and notified by the State Government.



Furthermore, this exclusion extends to the Metrorail Administration (MRA) and Project Implementing Agency designated by the Government for the MetroRail, Monorail and Light Rail Transit (LRT) Projects, and the functions of Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai such as Roads, Water Supply, Sewerage, Storm Water Disposal and any additional essential public services the Municipal Commissioner mandates. 



However, while these constructions are excluded from general regulations, they must adhere to certain provisions. They should meet the prescribed requirements for essential services, water supply connections, drains, and other elements, all validated to the Commissioner's satisfaction. 



Certain operational constructions are explicitly excluded from the scheme's scope, apart from restrictions pertaining to floor space index and fire precautions. These include



- Repairs and renovations of existing installations of buildings used solely for operational purposes, which do not result in additional built-up areas.


- For entities like the Railways, Metro Rail and Monorail/LRT Authority, repairing and renovating of existing railway tracks, culverts, bridges, tunnels, side drains, platforms, goods sheds and offices, parcel offices, substations, foot-over bridges, turning tables, signal boxes or control cabins in hump yards, running sheds, carriage depots, washing facilities, water tanks, pipelines, pumping stations, running rooms, yard depots, inspectors' offices and stores, and all overhead electric equipment for traction.


# Detailed Overview of Development Permission and Commencement Certificate under Regulation 9/Scheme 9


The **Operational Control Centre, Playback Training Room, Stabling Yards, Maintenance Workshop, Auto wash plant, Auxiliary Rail Vehicle Building, Under Floor Wheel Lathe & Blow Down Plant, Cooling Tower, Generator Area, and Auxiliary Substation** are all part of the structures requiring development permissions and commencement certificates under Regulation 9/Scheme 9.



Also included in this mandate are the **Traction Substation, Transformer Area, Water Treatment Plant, Waste water Treatment Plant, Depot, Control Centre, Sump Area, Parking Check post, Loading & Unloading Areas, Fouling Points, DG Set Rooms, Metro & Mono Stations (Underground & Elevated), Viaduct & Tunnel, Ventilation Shaft, Entry/Exit Block, Passages, Underground Passages to Station Box, Lift/ Staircases, Escalators, and Air Handling Unit**.



The regulation also pertains to constructions like **Store sheds**, but only if they are ancillary to operational requirements.



For the construction of new railway lines or tracks, the regulation notes the necessity for State Government approval. The construction of new buildings, goods stores, sheds or platforms, parcel offices and workshops, and major remodeling all require the approval of the Commissioner.



However, constructions by organizations, authorities or departments listed under sub-Regulation (2) including residential buildings, commercial buildings, office buildings and industrial buildings (other than gate lodges, essential operational staff quarters), roads and drains, hospitals, clubs, institutes, and schools that fall under residential, commercial or industrial areas won't be deemed operational for the purpose of exemption under this Regulation.



Additionally, constructions or extensions of buildings not mentioned under this Regulation are not deemed operational.



Regulation 9/Scheme 9 further states that no permissions are needed for tenantable repair works to existing buildings that have been constructed with competent authority's approval or that have existed since before a specific date, depending on whether it's for residential or non-residential structures.



The regulation also excludes the necessity for permissions for safety grills provisions to windows/ventilators, repairs to the existing consumer/distribution/receiving substation of the BEST/Electric Supply Company (with the caveat of no addition/alteration without the Commissioner's approval), and for the installation of Solar Panels at a specified height from the terrace ensuring structural stability from the Licensed Structural Engineer.


# Detailed Examination of Regulation 9/Scheme 9: Conditions for Development Permission and Commencement Certificate



Under Regulation 9/Scheme 9, no explicit approval is necessary for the addition of lightweight internal partitions or cabins up to a height of 2.2 metres in residential or commercial structures, assuming that the stability of the construction is upheld by a Licensed Structural Engineer. In addition to this, internal partitions or cabins that match the floor height are permissible if they adhere to the guidelines for light and ventilation set forth in these regulations, the fire safety standards certified by a fire safety consultant, and the structural stability requirements validated by a Licensed Structural Engineer.



Regarding the durability of development permissions, any permissions previously granted will remain governed by the conditions outlined under Section 48 of the MR&TP Act, 1966. If development has begun in accordance with permissions or Intimation of Disapproval (IOD) issued before the publication of these regulations, then the Commencement Certificate (CC) is either issued or revalidated until the development's completion, consistent with approved plans. It also covers any minor amendments made following the then-applicable regulations.



For ongoing or partially completed works which have obtained IOD/IOA, these works can proceed under the conditions set out when permissions were first approved. However, the span of such permissions cannot surpass what is outlined in Section 48 of the MRTP Act, 1966. An alternative is for the owner or developer to reorient the project to adhere to the provisions of DCPR2034.



Regarding projects that launched with the necessary permissions before the implementation of DCPR 2034, if the owner or developer chooses to undertake further development under DCPR 2034, then DCPR 2034 provisions apply towards the remaining creation of plots, buildings, or layouts. The developmental potential of the entire plot will then be calculated following DCPR 2034 guidelines, subtracting the sanctioned Floor Space Index (FSI) of structures or partial structures that are to be retained according to the officially approved plans.



Lastly, to simplify the implementation process and overcome hardship in transitional proposals, it's noted that the Municipal Commissioner has the authority to devise an appropriate policy.


# Detailed Procedure for Obtaining Development Permission and Commencement Certificate (CC)



_Section Topic: The Importance of Providing Notice of Intention_



The process of development or redevelopment, whether it involves the construction, alteration, or re-erection of a building, involves a crucial step of notifying the Commissioner in writing. This intended action must be communicated using the form provided in Appendix II. Accompanying the notice, specific plans and statements are required, with an adequate number of copies as mandated by sub-regulations (2) and (3). Even ordinary print copies of plans are acceptable.



Post issue of permission or refusal, one set of these submitted plans is kept in the Commissioner's Office for record preservation. The Commissioner also has the discretion to establish a policy requiring online submissions, approvals, and communication, pertaining to the process of obtaining development permission.

In situations when multiple owners exist, a lawyer with at least ten years of experience must certify that all co-owners have agreed for development. 



For tenanted properties due for redevelopment under Regulation no. 33(7), a MHADA or land-owning public authority certificate must illustrate that at least 51% certified and eligible tenants of the property or each building have irrevocably consented for redevelopment in favour of the owner or developer. The same requirement holds for redevelopments under Reg. No. 33(9), but it further necessitates that either at least 51% eligible tenants of the property and each building or overall 60% tenants must have provided such irrevocable consent. 



Additionally, an Indemnity Bond indemnifying MCGM and its officer from legal consequences pertaining to ownership disputes should accompany these documentation.


# Detailed Procedure for Acquiring Development Permission and Commencement Certificate (CC)



## Information Required Along with Notice Submission



For properties owned by cooperative societies, a certificate is required from an advocate with at least a 10-year experience within this field. The certificate must confirm that the registered society/society on the redevelopment plot has entered into a registered agreement with the developer. This agreement permits the redevelopment project, and at least 70% of society members present in a Special General Body Meeting convened for this purpose have approved the redevelopment. These members have also consented to the redevelopment by the applicant per provisions of the relevant Act.



For properties in the layout and owned by MHADA/Land owing public authority, a certificate is required from MHADA or the land owning public authority. This certificate should verify that a minimum of 51% of the certified and legal occupants of the property have allowed consent in favor of the developer.



In scenarios where the land is leased by the Government or local authorities, clearance regarding the observance of lease conditions must be obtained from the Government or these authorities respectively. This clearance should be attached to the application for development permission concerning such land.



The Commissioner may prescribe additional documents as necessary.



It's also required to provide a declaration cum affidavit from the owner, developer, or applicant. This document should state that construction materials like aggregate will be sourced from authorized quarries.

# Detailed Procedure for Obtaining Development Permission and Commencement Certificate(CC)



## Rules for Signing of Plans by Owners and Licensed Personnel/Architect



Owners and the licensed surveyor, engineer, structural engineer, supervisor, architect, or any Professional on Record, as applicable, should sign all plans. Following nearly universal best practice, they must inscribe their names using block capital letters and furnish their addresses along with license numbers, granted by the Commissioner. It is essential to note that these professionals must be those listed in the document referenced as Annexure 10. 



## Eligibility and Capability Criteria for Licensed Surveyor/ Engineer/ Structural Engineer/Supervisor/Professional on Record 



To attain a license, surveyors, engineers, structural engineers, and supervisors must meet the qualifications listed in Annexure 10. The Commissioner bestows these licenses, allowing these professionals to perform the tasks described within the same document - Annexure 10.


# Procedure for Obtaining Development Permission and Commencement Certificate


## Processing the Development Permission Application



- The Commissioner has the authority to either approve or deny the submitted plans and specifications for development. The Commissioner's decision can include necessary modifications or directions, and should be communicated to the applicant as per the formats outlined in Annexure 11 and 12.


  
- It is mandatory that all plans for high-rise or special buildings undergo examination by the Chief Fire Officer prior to approval. The Commissioner will only grant development permission after obtaining clearance from the Chief Fire Officer. 


  
- If the Commissioner does not communicate his approval, disapproval, or necessary modifications or directions within sixty days from receipt of an application under sub-Regulations 1 of Regulations 10, then it's inferred that the submitted plans and statements have received approval. However, this should not be interpreted as authorization for any actions that might contravene the terms of land lease, the development plan, regulations, or any laws in force.


   
- If the initial plans have been reviewed and objections have surfaced, the applicant must amend the plans to address all raised concerns and resubmit them. The re-submitted plans for final rendition must not include superimposed corrections. After reviewing the revised plans, the Commissioner will make a final decision to grant or deny the development permission or commencement certificate, within sixty days from the date of resubmission.


# Procedure to Acquire Development Permission and Commencement Certificate


This section outlines the procedure for obtaining a Development Permission and a Commencement Certificate (CC). 



The term of validity for a Development Permission / Commencement Certificate spans four years in total. However, renewal is obligatory before the close of one year from the issuance date. If the work has not initiated, the application for renewal should be submitted prior to the conclusion of the first year. This renewal process can extend up to three additional consecutive terms of one year each. Beyond this, proposals must be put forward for securing development permission. 



Clarifying the aspect of 'Commencement', it is important to define the term with regard to this regulation. For ease of understanding, the term 'Commencement' has been defined in the context of different types of construction.



- In the context of a building work, which includes additions and alterations, 'Commencement' signifies the stage up to plinth level. In case there is no plinth, it includes the stage up to the upper level of the lower basement or stilt. 



- When referring to bridges and overhead tanks, 'Commencement' refers to the completion of foundation and construction work up to the base floor.



- For underground works, 'Commencement' stands for completion of the foundation and construction work up to the floor of the underground level. 



- For layout, subdivision, and amalgamation proposals, 'Commencement' means the successful conclusion of final demarcation and provisions of infrastructure and services up to the following stages: completion of water bound macadam for roads, and completion of excavation and base concreting for sewerage, drainage, and water supply facilities.


# Detailed Process for Obtaining the Development Permission and Commencement Certificate (CC)



The process of obtaining Development Permission and the Commencement Certificate (CC) necessitates the payment of various fees and charges. These include the development charges, premiums, development cess, off-site infrastructure charges, and other applicable fees. It is essential to note that the permission or CC will only be granted once the requisite payments have been made to the respective governmental or municipal authorities. 



Development made without these necessary payments will be deemed as unauthorized. Therefore, every developer must adhere to these financial obligations for their proposal to be considered valid and authorized.



The Commissioner has special permission to decide on the modalities of the procedure for Development Permission. This includes the possibility of implementing an online approval process to enhance the ease of doing business. Importantly, each payment instruction should be followed accurately to avoid any unauthorized development activities. 



In the context of development permission payment modalities:



- It is critical to make timely payment of development charges, premiums, development cess, and off-site infrastructure charges.


- A Commencement Certificate is only granted on completion of all the requisite payments.


- Developments that proceed without completing the necessary payments will into the category of unauthorized developments.


- For smooth and effortless procedures, the Commissioner can decide on alternate methods, such as online approval processes, under the purview of improving the Ease of Doing Business.


#  Detailed Procedures During Construction Process



## Conformance with Regulations & Owner's Responsibility



The owner's liability remains significant irrespective of the approval of sketches, specifications, and inspections by the Commissioner during construction. Neither the grant of permission nor the approval of drawings and specifications, nor Commissioner inspections during the building's construction in any way alleviate the owner's responsibility to ensure the construction works align with these regulations. 



## Adhering to Noise Pollution Rules



During the construction, the provisions of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control), Rules 2000 as amended up to date should be strictly observed and adhered to in letter and spirit.



##  Notification Prior to Initiation of Work



It's mandatory for the owner to notify the Commissioner about their intention to commence work on the construction site, as outlined in Annexure 13. The construction work can only begin after a minimum of 7 days from the service of such notice to the Commissioner, or earlier if approved.



## Essential Documentation Onsite 



Necessary records like test results for material conformity with the regulations need to be readily available for inspection during and post-construction as required by the Commissioner. Furthermore, the development permission, approved drawings, specifications, professional contact details, and remarks from various departments related to the development should be conspicuously available onsite.



## Assessment of Plinth Columns and Plinth Level



Upon completion of work up to the plinth level, the owner, through his licensed surveyor or architect, needs to notify the Commissioner using the form provided in Annexure 14. This allows the Commissioner to confirm compliance with sanctioned plans. If the Commissioner doesn't decline permission within fifteen days of receiving the notice, the permission is considered granted assuming the work remains as per the approved plans.



##  Procedure for Planned Deviations



In case of any substantial deviations from the sanctioned plans during construction, such as external or internal additions, prior approval from the Commissioner is imperative. An updated plan highlighting the intended changes should be submitted for review. Any work performed in violation of the approved plans without the Commissioner's preliminary consent is deemed unauthorized.


# Procedure during Construction: Certificates, Inspections, and Completion Procedures



## Completion Certificates



The building owner is required to provide a drainage completion certificate through a licensed plumber to the Commissioner following the format found on Annexure 17. A building completion certificate, obtained from a licensed surveyor, engineer, structural engineer, supervisor, architect or any professional on record who supervised the construction, is also required and must be formatted according to Annexure 18. Three sets of completed development plans should accompany these certificates.



Upon receiving these certificates, the Commissioner will inspect the completed work to ensure conformity with approved plans. After satisfactory inspection, he will issue an acceptance certificate of the completion, formatted as per Annexure 19. Once the Commissioner receives the development completion certificate as per Annexure 16 and verifies the absence of deviation from sanctioned plans, they may issue a Building Completion certificate as outlined in Annexure 22 or decline within 21 days from the receipt of the request. An allowable deviation of 25 mm in outer dimension is accepted if the carpet area remains unchanged. 



## Occupancy Certificate 



After receiving an acceptance of completion certificate (Annexure 19), the owner should submit to the Commissioner a development completion certificate, as indicated in Annexure 16, along with three copies of the completion plan. The Commissioner may proceed to inspect the work. If the construction has followed the approved plans, the Commissioner may issue an occupancy certificate as per Annexure 20 or refuse to do so within 21 days from the receipt of the said completion certificate. If work conforms to sanctioned plans and no occupancy certificate is issued within the 21-day period, the work is deemed approved for occupation. The reasons for refusal or rejection of the certificate, if this is the case, will be communicated to the owner in writing. 



## Part Occupancy and Building Completion Certificates 



At the request of the owner, the Commissioner may issue partial occupancy or building completion certificates for a section of the building even before the entirety of the work is completed, as long as safety and public health controls are in place. These part occupancy or building completion certificates are issued subject to the owner indemnifying the Commissioner as described in Annexure 21.


# Detailed Overview of Building Inspection Processes and Safeguards



## Procedures for Regular and Unplanned Inspections



The Commissioner reserves the right to carry out an inspection at any stage during the erection or development of a building, without any prior notice. This pertains to inspections across all stages of a building's construction or development.



## Criteria for Permission from Fire Department for High-Rise and Special Buildings



If a building is classified as high-rise or special, inspections by the Chief Fire Officer must also take place. The Commissioner will only issue the occupancy certificate or building completion certificate once the Chief Fire Officer has given clearance.



## Regulations for Unsafe Buildings



Buildings identified as unsafe pose a threat to public safety, health, and sanitation. These buildings should be restored through repair work or demolished according to the Commissioner's directives.



## Addressing Unauthorized Developments



If a development is found to be unauthorized, the Commissioner is responsible for taking appropriate action. This action may include the demolition of unauthorized work as outlined in Section 53 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966 and the relevant provisions of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888.



## Responsibility of the Architect/Licensed Surveyor to report Unauthorized Work



The Architect or Licensed Surveyor is obligated to inform the Commissioner immediately if any unauthorized work or development takes place. The owner or developer should also be notified in writing to stop the work, or else the Architect or licensed surveyor may face action.



## Ensuring Safety Precautions On-Site



The responsibility of ensuring safety measures on the construction site and surrounding areas rests with the owner or developer and respective professionals they hire. This is particularly important for the safety of the engaged workmen, and the directives from Constructional Practices & Safety, National Building Code of India, updated to the latest amendment.



## MCGM's Liability Towards Public Safety and Nuisance/Inconvenience



The granting of IOD/C.C/O.C or any written directive to ensure public safety or reduce nuisance or inconvenience does not hold MCGM liable for any injury, damages, or losses caused to persons in or around the construction site.



## Revoking of Permission by Commissioner



Without infringing on Section 51 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966's revocation powers, the Municipal Commissioner can revoke any development permission where false statements or misrepresentation of material facts were found in the application. The work done under such permission will then be deemed unauthorized. 



## No Compensation for Revocation of Permission



In the event of a development's permission being revoked under sub-regulation (i), no compensation will be provided.


# Heading 1: Development Stipulations Governing Land, Building or Premises 


## Subheading 1: General Guidelines for Development or Redevelopment



- A paramount stipulation in any development or redevelopment case concerning any land, building, or premises is for the intended use to align with the predetermined use zones. This is also expected to reflect the purpose of its designation, allocation, or reservation. This applies unless indicated otherwise in individual specifications.





# Detailed Stipulations for Development of Existing Amenities, Reservations, and Partly Existing Amenities



## A. Development Guidelines for Existing Amenities:



1. At sites where there is an existing amenity in a building, it's necessary that the development should comprise a minimum buildable area (BUA) equivalent to the current amenity. Depending upon the regulations, any remaining permissible BUA can be utilized differently.



2. If the Development Plan labels the plot as an existing amenity with a plus (+) sign for public purposes, the authorized BUA used for the said public purpose must be maintained during the plot's reconstruction or redevelopment.



3. The Commissioner has the discretion to give special written permission to develop the buildable amenity for other public objectives if he/she feels that the existing amenity is not necessary due to availability of similar amenities nearby, considering administrative ward's deficiency.



4. If a site is marked as an existing amenity based on valid development permissions (excluding PPL), as per the LOI issued under the principle of AR/I to R &C, and the designated amenity is not developed or under development, the owner/developer may choose to proceed with the development in accordance with previously granted permission or the current regulations, considering the reservation area as per then DP. 



5. In the case where MCGM/Appropriate Authority relinquishes tenancy in a private existing amenity plot, it is considered that the existing amenity on this plot has consequently lapsed. If with appropriate permissions, the usage of the existing amenity ceases on the private land, it can be further developed under the Commissioner's special permission contemplating permissible uses in that zone. 



6. Schools that have been established on unreserved plots but now fall under the category of existing amenities in DP 2034, due to their land use, can be redeveloped in the future using the additional FSI benefits available in DCPR. However, they must abide by DCPR regulations and government policy terms and conditions. Merely showing the existing land use as an existing amenity for a school would not authorize it unless it complies with the prevailing regulations, terms and conditions, and government policy.





# Detailed Examination of Development Stipulations: Focus on the Status of Amenity/Reservation Plots 


   
One key principle in development stipulations revolves around the condition of existing amenity or reservation plots. Amenity or reservation plots can also be partially existing or partly reserved.



If land demarcated as an existing amenity spreads across several adjoining plots as outlined in DP 2034, and if any plot within this collection has failed to contribute to its reservation based on DP 1991, which is now considered a part of the existing amenity, it will be declared reserved for such intent. This plot will then face development following Regulation No. 17's guidelines.



There exists an exception to this rule specifically for Traffic Islands. Traffic Islands, which are part of the road, can be integrated into the main carriageway intending to enhance traffic flow. Such integration can only occur with the explicit written consent of the Commissioner and only under circumstances where these islands aren't factored into open space calculations.


# Detailed Analysis of Development Stipulations for Existing and Partially Existing Amenity, Reservation, and Amenity Plot



## Development Constraints of the Existing Amenity, Reservation, and Partially Existing Amenity, Reservation, and Amenity Plot



According to the regulations, any land that has been reserved in the Development Plan (DP) must adhere to specific development guidelines. This mandate follows the stipulations as detailed in Regulation No. 17 and Tables No. 3, 4, & 5 concerning land use and the manner of development.



One sentence to denote the information from said tables could be:



- Land designated in the Development Plan (DP) must be developed according to the mandates laid out in Regulation No. 17, specifically referencing Tables No. 3, 4, & 5 for thorough guidelines on land use and development methodologies. 



This enhances the clarity of the development requirements for any reserved land under the purview of the DP, especially those that are either existing amenities, reservations, or partially either of the two.


# Detailed Guidelines on Development Stipulations for Existing Amenities



## Development Conditions for Existing Amenity/Reservation/Partly Existing Amenity/Partly Reserved/Amenity Plot



When an existing building is situated on a site that is classified as an existing amenity in the Development Plan (DP), the part of the land appropriately used for existing amenity shall be exclusively utilized for the same purpose. 



The residual portion of the land/building from the developable land could be used in alignment with the development purposes as otherwise accepted under these regulations. This stipulation ensures that only those areas of the land that have been exclusively set aside for amenities are used for that purpose, while the remaining parts of the land/building are developed in accordance with the intended purpose specified in the Development Plan.


#  13: Stipulations for Development


##  Guidelines for the Development of Existing Amenity, Reservation, Partly Existing Amenity, Partly Reserved, or Amenity Plot



When the Planning or Appropriate Authority gains possession of a land classified as an amenity plot according to these Regulations, the plot is required to be used solely for the public purpose as determined by the Municipal Commissioner. During the use of the plot, provisions of Accommodation Reservation (AR) outlined in Regulation No. 17 are exempted from application, reinforcing the exclusivity of the plot for public utilities or purposes. 



This indicates that the specific land plot, upon acquisition by the Planning or Appropriate Authority, should be employed exclusively for serving public interests, as per decision taken by the Municipal Commissioner. Furthermore, in this context, it is critical to remember that the Accommodation Reservation (AR) under Regulation No. 17 is not applicable to such plots. 



In essence, this mandates the sole and specific usage of an acquired amenity plot for public purposes. It further negates any application of the Accommodation Reservation (AR) under Regulation No. 17 to such plots.


# Detailed Guidelines and Conditions For Mixed Use Development In Reserved Areas



## Rules and Regulations Governing the Mixed Use of Land/Buildings/Premises for Public Purposes by Appropriate Authority



When the Corporation or any authoritative agency decides to use the land, building, or the premises initially reserved for one specific public purpose, for other public purposes, they can do so after obtaining prior approval from the government. It is essential that the amalgamation of such diversified usages aligns with the underlying regulations and permissible use in the zone where the site is located.



### Special Exceptions to Mixed Land Use Regulations



However, it is important to note that these regulations do not apply to certain cases where the use of premises differs significantly. For instance, the rule will not apply to:



- A site being utilized for educational purposes, where provision for a bank branch or an ATM may be approved.


- A site under development for health services, where shops mainly for pharmacists, chemists, or an ATM might be permissible.


- A site being redeveloped for educational purposes but previously used for non-educational operation, current non-educational uses can continue without any increment in their net floor area.


- A site designated as a Public Open Space (POS).


# Detailed Guidelines about the Reservation for Multiple Public Purposes in Development Stipulations



In the context of land development stipulations, when land is earmarked for a variety of public purposes within the Development Plan (DP), the allocation of land area or Built-up Area (BUA) under reservation for each public purpose is advised to be comparably equal. 



Should there be a circumstance where a plot is specially reserved for a public purpose marked with a plus (+) sign in the DP, it's mandated that at least 50% of the plot's total area must be dedicated to the purpose it is reserved for in the DP. The remaining portion can be employed for other purposes associated with the plus (+) sign, maintaining cognizance of the deficit in that specific ward.



Extending the guidelines further, in scenarios where distinct percentages for multiple public purposes are stipulated in the DP, those outlined percentages are to be strictly adhered to. This implies that the stated percentage in the DP takes precedence.



Additionally, when reservations for public amenities are proposed on already designated plots (those with a developed amenity, but with the land's full potential not utilized), the area of reservations will be set by the Municipal Commissioner. This applies if it has not been previously defined by the DP.


# Detailed Guidelines Pertaining to the Development Stipulations: Area of Reserved Land


## Regulation Statements



1. In terms of the stipulations around the development, the process of calculating the area of reserved land should be duly noted. 


2. The area considered as reserved land is established by deducting areas designated for specific purposes. These deductions comprise the area under the projected Development Plan (DP) Road, the Prescribed Regular line, and the existing Municipal Road that may influence the reservation in consideration.


3. An important stipulation to remember during the process of area reservation for a development project is that the total area should be considered post the deduction of the DP Road, Prescribed Regular line, and any Existing Municipal Road affecting the reservation.


4. As per the standing development stipulations, the computation of the area of reserved land will exclude the space taken up by the proposed DP Road, the Prescribed Regular line, and any Existing Municipal Road influencing the reservation.



## Integration of Infrastructure



1. The actual area of land to be set aside as reserved, according to the development stipulations, is calculated after subtracting the land areas earmarked for infrastructure elements such as the DP Road, Prescribed Regular line, and the Municipal Road.


2. The size of the reserved land, following the development stipulations, is understood to have deducted the area utilized for planned infrastructure like the DP Road, Prescribed Regular line, and Existing Municipal Road affecting the reservation.



## Deductions from Reserved Land Area



1. The area of the reservation as per the development stipulations excludes any land space taken up by planned or existing infrastructure such as the proposed DP Road, the Prescribed Regular line, and the already existing Municipal Road that could impact the reserve area.


2. In accordance with the development stipulations, the calculation of reserved land area deducts areas earmarked for the DP Road, the Prescribed Regular line, and any Municipal Roads that may affect the space allocated for the reservation.


# 13.0 Provisions for Developing and Modifying Current Civic Spaces and Reserves 



## 13.6 Title: Guidelines for Modifying or Relocating Existing Amenities and Reservations



When dealing with specific existing amenities or reservations as outlined in the Development Plan (DP), the Commissioner may alter or relocate these elements given the permission of the property owners. This movement or modification can occur within the same territory or on adjacent land within the same zone. However, it's important that the relocated existing amenity or reservation abuts a public street with equal or broader width as per the DP. These relocated entities should have the same visibility from the road, remain unencumbered, and not have their area reduced.



Commissioner's decision involving these changes will be documented in a reasoned order. This, along with a certified copy of the updated plan, will be shared with the Director of Town Planning, Pune and the State Government.



It must be noted that this shifting of reservations or existing amenities is not permissible if:



- The amenity or reservation proposed for relocation is divided into parts.


- The relocation is beyond the same holding of the owner where such reservation or existing amenity is sited.


- The new location and area do not match the original location and area of the reservation or amenity as denoted in the original DP.


# Developmental Guidelines: Considerations for Temporal Utilization of Public Open Spaces (POS) for Art and Culture within Specific Timeframes



Art and Culture serve as a significant vehicle for societal enrichment and growth, often necessitating the conversion of public properties into cultural hubs. The Commissioner possesses the authority to authorize temporary usage of POS such as Gardens, Leisure Parks, multi-purpose community centers, libraries, reading rooms, public halls, Heritage area and Heritage Precincts, educational complexes, parking lots, institutional areas for the intention of Art and Culture. 



This allowance includes various cultural events and activities such as circus, jatra, folk dance, meditation, and related undertakings within defined time slots when the primary utility and function of such spaces are not under operation. 



Importantly, while considering these temporary uses, it is critical to ascertain that the primary purpose of these premises is neither compromised nor impaired. This balance is key to maintaining the functionality of the spaces while also offering an opportunity for public enjoyment and cultural growth.


# Detailed Insights into Development Stipulations: Temporary Vending Zone Regulations



The Commissioner holds the authority, under special circumstances, to convert certain pre-established amenities, as deemed appropriate, into a temporary vending zone. Public parking lots are an example of these types of facilities. It's vital to note that although they're converted into vending zones, their primary function remains temporarily on hold and not entirely dismissed. The temporary suspension period of the primary activities should not exceed the duration of one to four hours per week, specifically during weekends.



Further clarifying the rules, the main user of the existing amenity land or premises would be required to respect this temporary suspension. This rule is a reminder that the primary use of the amenity land or premises should not be compromised or impaired due to its conversion into a vending zone.



The stipulations highlight that although these areas can become temporary vending zones, the main objective is to ensure that there isn't any negative impact on the primary use of the areas. These guidelines provide a comprehensive understanding of the commissioner's rights to allow such alterations while ensuring the primary usage of the public amenities aren't hindered.


# Detailed Description on Development Stipulations Related to Art & Culture and Temporary Vending Zones



In reference to Art & Culture and Temporary Vending Zones or markets such as Bajar-hat, Athawadi Bazar, or Equal Street, the stipulated guidelines indicate that the Municipal Commissioner is responsible for identifying and providing appropriate locations. The identified spaces for conducting such activities may be on streets or roads and are typically operational on weekends or holidays, as specifically determined by the Municipal Commissioner.



These locations or stretches of roads can serve dual purposes - they can be used as recreational or play areas and also be utilized for the aforementioned activities. The responsibility of identifying public domains, including roads for conducting night bazaars, is also vested in the Municipal Commissioner. It is of utmost importance to note that the authority to identify these spaces should not be delegated to any other entity or person, and must remain solely with the Municipal Commissioner.


# Detailed Scope of Amenities Provision in Land Parcels Measuring 4000 sq. m or More



In relation to the development of land areas accounting for 4000 sq.m or more (excluding the Road set back/DP Road), this falls under Residential and Commercial Zones. Amenity areas specified must front on public road or provided with a perpetual independent right of way. The area of such amenities excludes any land under a perpetual independent right of way and should be transferred to MCGM. 



Individual plot developments measuring between 4000 sq.m and 10,000 sq. m necessitate assigning 5% of the plot area to MCGM as a Public Open Space (POS). 



When a development plot surpasses 10,000 sq. m, this requires the transfer of 500 sq. m and an additional 10% of the plot area that exceeds 10,000 sq. m to MCGM as an amenity. Half of this amenity must be reserved exclusively for POS, while the remaining 50% should be used for other amenities like education, health, and social services with the Commissioner’s special permission. 



The Commissioner will adjudicate the amenity, taking into account the amenity deficits in the specific ward. Amenities or facilities defined in clauses (i) and (ii) will be considered as designations or reservations in the DP subsequently. 



In cases where the DP has indicated any reservations on the plot under development excluding the DP Road/Road set back, a criteria is applicable:



- If the area under DP reservation to be given to MCGM (excluding the DP Road/Road set back) is less than the required amenity area as per this regulation, then only the additional area will be provided for amenity. 


- If the area under DP reservation to be given to MCGM (excluding the DP Road/Road set back) exceeds the mandatory amenity area as per the same regulation, then there is no need for an additional amenity.



The amenity’s size should be exempt from plot calculations for ascertaining the feasible floor space index (FSI). The public open space (POS) area would be in addition to the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) as required by Regulation No.27. 



For any such amenity, no side should be less than 7.5 meters. Where the average width of an amenity falls under 16.6 meters, its length should not be more than 2.5 times its average width.



Please note:


No amenity plot will be carved out of any land exclusively set aside for public purpose. Under redevelopments following clause 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(10), the requirement for amenity as per this regulation shall decrease to 35%. With plot amalgamations, no amenity is required for the original plot less than 4000 sq.mt. But if the amalgamated plots exceed 20000 sq.mt., the amenity as per this regulation becomes applicable.


# 14: Amenities - Converting Industrial Zone to Residential or Commercial Zone and Permissible Uses


Section B discusses the process of converting an open land in the Industrial Zone (I-Zone), excluding cotton textile mills, into a Commercial or Residential zone. The conversion must be approved by the Commissioner and can only be for permissible uses in the Residential Zone (R-Zone) or Commercial Zone (C-Zone). 



# Converted Area Calculation


The conversion area is calculated after considering the deducted area of proposed DP Road/Prescribed Regular line/Existing Municipal Road affecting the plots.



# Premium Payment for Conversion


The conversion process necessitates the payment of a premium, at the rate of 20% of the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR rate) for developed land, or another rate as determined by the government from time to time. Half of the premium goes to the Government and is deposited in the office of the Deputy Director of Town Planning, Greater Mumbai.



# NOC from Labour Commissioner


The conversion of Industrial Zone to Residential/Commercial Zone for closed factories is subject to the receipt of No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Labour Commissioner, Government of Maharashtra (GoM). If the land has never been used for industry, no NOC is required from the Labour Commissioner.



# Amenity Provision for Conversion


If the land mass under conversion measures less than 2000 sq. m, either 10% amenity in open land form or 5% of built-up area at Zonal (basic) FSI are to be handed over to the MCGM free of charge, in the shape of residential or commercial premises.



# Plot Area & Amenities for Conversion


For converted plot areas equal to 2000 sq. m or more, the amenity spaces to be handed over to MCGM are as follows:



1. For plot areas of 2000 sq. m or more, but less than 2 ha, 10% of the land area should be designated as a public open space (POS).


2. For plot areas of 2 ha or more, but less than 5 ha, 2000 sq. m plus 20% of the excess plot area over 2 ha is to be handed over. At least 50% of this amenity should be designated as a POS reservation.


3. For plot areas of 5 ha or more, 8000 sq. m plus 25% of the excess plot area over 5 ha is to be handed over. At least 50% of this amenity should also be designated as a POS reservation.



Developer may provide constructed amenities as decided by the Commissioner. In such instances, Transferable Development Rights (TDR) will be given in lieu of the cost of construction of the built-up amenity, as per the provisions of Regulation 17(1) note 1(d).


# Chapter 14: Amenities and Conversion of Industrial Zone to Residential or Commercial Zone



In the scope of the utilization of industrial zones for either residential or commercial purposes, the provisions dictate that such areas will serve as an addition to the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) as required under Regulation No.27. Also, the required distance for segregation prescribed by these rules must be maintained within the land designated for residential or commercial uses. 



It shall be noted that residential or commercial development within these converted zones shall adhere to the permissible FSI of the adjoining Residential or Commercial Zone. Additionally, the provisions extended for public utilities and amenities will be acknowledged as reservations in the Development Plan (DP). According to Regulation No.17, public utility and amenity shall not be subject to any form of development under AR. Instead, the entire plot of amenity shall be utilized for the purpose of public amenity or POS per the provisions of sub-regulation 14(B)(c)(ii) of this regulation.



## Note on Conversion and Regulations



The conversion from an industrial zone to a residential or commercial zone will be applicable only to a part of the land holding. The conditions dictate that the total area of the land holding will be considered while deciding the premium payment and the percentage of land to be reserved for amenity as prescribed by this regulation.



Should a Development Plan present a reservation on a plot that is to be converted from an Industrial Zone to the Residential/Commercial Zone, the following stipulations apply:



- When the land area under DP reservation to be handed over to the MCGM, exclusive of the areas under DP roads or road setback, falls short of the required amenity area for this regulation, only the extra land area shall be provided for amenity.


- Conversely, if the above-mentioned area exceeds the required amenity area, the provision for amenity isn't necessary.


- For plot areas under conversion measuring less than 2000 sq. m, either a 10% amenity in the form of open land or a 5% built-up amenity shall be counted for the calculation of amenity as indicated in note (a) and (b).


- As for the total floor area designated for residential development under basic FSI, 20% of it will be constructed for residential tenements, each housing a carpet area of up to 50 sq.m.



In the event that the development is currently progressing and a full Occupation Certificate has been denied for any of the layout buildings, the land owner or developer can enact the conversion as per this regulation under certain conditions. In other words, the revised regulations will be entirely applicable. However, landowners or developers can't benefit from both the old and revised rules. The revised regulations will only be applicable for cases in which a full Occupation Certificate hasn't been granted for any of the layout's buildings and where the required amenity or DP reservation if any, hasn't been submitted to the Corporation.


#  Conversion of Industrial Zone to Residential or Commercial Zone: Regulations and Usage Specifications



The following discusses the rules and guidelines involved in the conversion of a zone designated for industrial use into a residential or commercial zone. Within these regulations, we explain the uses permitted in the newly converted residential or commercial zone.



The regulations stipulate that 20% of the built-up area rezoned for residential purposes, guided by the basic Floor Space Index (FSI), must be put aside for a commercial objective. This particular condition aligns with the residential or commercial uses permissible under these regulations.



Furthermore, the text highlights a critical regulation for industrial lands acquired under Part VII of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. It states that before sanctioning residential or commercial uses on such lands, obtaining prior permission from the government is mandatory. If any land falls under this category, it will also be subject to the terms and conditions laid out in the Revenue Department's Government Resolution (G.R.) No. MISC-01/2017/C.R.11/A-2, dated January 11, 2018. These regulations ensure the correct and legal conversion of industrial zones to residential or commercial zones, preserving the integrity and balance of land uses.


# Inclusive Housing (IH) Provisions for Residential Developments in Maharashtra



The Maharashtra Government mandates that all residential developments comprising of sub-division, amalgamation, or layout of a single plot of land with a gross plot area measuring at least 4000 sq.m. (excluding areas reserved for road setbacks, DP roads, or existing amenities) must include provisions for Inclusive Housing (IH). 



This IH mandate consists of Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low-Income Group (LIG) housing, representing IH tenements. The IH tenements range from a carpet area size of 25 to 27.88 square meters, adjusted as per regulations set forth by the Housing Department of Maharashtra. 



Rules state that IH tenements must account for at least 20% of the Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI), preferably localized within a separate wing or building in the housing complex. These tenements will be handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). 



The Built-Up Area (BUA) of IH, equivalent to 20% of the plot's Zonal (basic) FSI, does not count towards the total FSI. Therefore, the BUA of these IH tenements is permitted beyond the permissible BUA under existing regulations. The construction of the stock of IH tenements must occur on the same plot. 



However, IH's BUA can be provided at other locations within the same administrative ward, given that the BUA for MCGM is equivalent to the Annual Schedule Rates (ASR). This construction will be free of FSI up to 40% of the Zonal (basic) FSI, above the permissible BUA of such plot/alternative plot. 



The BUA calculation follows a specific formula:


- Built-Up Area B = Built-Up Area A X (RR-A / RR-B)


- Where:


  - Built-Up Area A refers to the BUA of IH units proposed to be transferred from plot A.


  - Built-Up Area B signifies the BUA of IH units to be handed over to MCGM at plot B in lieu of BUA of plot A.


  - RR-A and RR-B are the Ready Reckoner Rates for BUA at plots A and B, respectively.



Developers must immediately inform concerned MCGM departments upon completion of IH tenements under this scheme, and provide pertinent details, including the Occupation Certificate issued by the Planning Authority. 



The distribution of IH tenements is as follows:


- 20% of such tenements are allocated to Project-Affected People (PAP) of vital infrastructure projects, preferably from the same ward.


- The remaining 80% of tenements are assigned to EWS/LIG households for outright sale through a lottery system overseen by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA).


- If MCGM does not require tenements within six months from the notification of completion, they may be sold in alignment with the procedure for EWS/LIG households.


- Proceeds from the sale of these tenements are deployed by MCGM for Development Plan (DP) implementation.


# Inclusive Housing (IH): Regulatory Obligations of Developers and Owners in Relation to Built-Up Area and Construction Costs



The developer or property owner is allowed built-up area (BUA) in lieu of the cost of construction for inclusive housing (IH) units. The calculation for this exchange is based on a ratio of 1.5, utilizing the rate of construction per square meter according to the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR), as well as the rate of developed land per square meter according to ASR with a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 1. The BUA of Inclusive Housing is also incorporated into this calculation.



It's important to note that a BUA in lieu of the cost of construction for IH can be approved in addition to the permitted FSI as specified in Regulation No.30, Table 12. This BUA may also be adjusted against allowed Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) or additional FSI after premium payment, which is currently in abeyance.



The starting point for a Commencement Certificate in lieu of BUA for IH occurs only after the concerned BUA has been transferred to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). Approval can also occur before claiming Zonal (basic) FSI beyond 75% of the plot area, or granting an Occupation Certificate to the last 25% of the approved FSI in any building other than IH - whichever happens first.



When calculating the number of tenements, the BUA to carpet area ratio should be considered as 1.2. This includes requirements in accordance with these Regulations. However, no separate compensation is provided for areas under Regulation No. 31(1). BUA allocated for infrastructure like staircases, lifts, lobbies, and similar areas are not included in the BUA to be transferred and must be provided without charging a premium for the provision of IH tenements.



For redevelopment projects involving a Co-operative Housing Society, federation of societies, association, or condominium/apartment owner’s association, there is no obligation to construct IH tenements if the carpet area for all existing individual residential units does not exceed 80 sq.m. However, in a scenario where the existing carpet area of some of the residential units exceeds 80 sq. m, there is an obligation to hand over the BUA as IH tenements/plot area, proportionate to the ratio of BUA for such tenement having carpet area more than 80 sq. m and the existing BUA, as per this Regulation considering plot area.



This rule does not apply to individual bungalows in Bungalow Scheme redevelopment. Nonetheless, it is applicable if the redevelopment in the Bungalow Scheme or a plot with an area exceeding 4000 sq. m under layout is proposed.


# Inclusive Housing Regulations and Conditions (Section 15)



In the context of redevelopment projects that come under the ambit of Regulation No. 33(2), 33(3)(A), 33(3)(B), 33(5), 33(6), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(8), 33(9), 33(9)(A), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(11), 33(20), Regulation No 35 and Regulation No.14(B), there is no mandated requirement to build Inclusive Housing (IH) tenements as per the given regulations. This condition applies to any Housing scheme or residential development project wherein, due to specific sections of the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR), more than 20% of the Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) is necessitated for the construction of Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low-Income Group (LIG) tenements. The above-mentioned rules also extend to the development of lands located in Special Development Zones (SDZ) as specified by Regulation No 33(8) and to the development or redevelopment of lands owned by either the Government or Semi-Government organizations, where such a project is led by the organizations themselves. 



The regulations strictly forbid the amalgamation of Inclusive Housing (IH) tenements. 



Post the approval of the project layout, further subdivision may be required to designate separate lots for the IH component and the other parts. The Plot area and the Built-up Area (BUA) in square meters within the said plot must be separately denoted in the lease agreements and Record of Rights. In line with this, the Chief title survey Officer or Sub-Land Registrar of the district, upon the payment of a decided fee, ensures the rectification of the City Survey sheet and property cards. Consequently, new property cards are issued for each of the plots. These cards present specific details regarding the area of the plots, the total built-up property area across floors, and the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) provided, i.e., the FSI used in that specific plot.


# Detailed Provisions for Road and Road Widening Under the DP and MMC Act, 1888



1. According to the DP and the MMC Act, 1888, the owner bears responsibility for surrendering the required area for road widening or newly proposed roads to MCGM free of cost and without any encumbrances.


   
2. The owner must level the land to the surrounding ground level and construct a 1.5 m. high compound wall, leaving the setback area as directed by the Commissioner.



3. Upon completion, the road land must be transferred to the Corporation's name in the Revenue records (P.R. card) and will become part of a public street as defined in subsection 3 of section 288 of the MMC Act, 1888.



4. Under Regulation No. 30 & 32, the FSI/TDR in lieu of the surrendered land will be permissible, with exceptions for proposals processed under Regulation No 33(5), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(9), 33(9)(A), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(20)(A), 33(21).



5. In cases where development of the plot/layout is already complete and road widening is proposed under the sanctioned road line prescribed in the MMC Act 1888, the plot owner is entitled to a BUA as per the Zonal (basic) FSI/TDR of the surrendered plot. 



6. No monetary compensation is required, as the plot is surrendered to MCGM/Appropriate Authority without cost or encumbrance, as decided by the Competent Authority.



7. For all Flyovers constructed by the Government/MCGM/Appropriate Authority, noise barriers, as defined in Regulation No. 2(IV) (85), must be provided wherever necessary.


# Detailed Description and Development of Reserved Lands for Public Purposes under Section 17(1)



The concept of reserved lands, which are to be exclusively developed by either the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or the Appropriate Authority, is delineated in this section. The acquisition of these lands may result from monetary compensation, Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), or other methods.



An integral aspect is that the owner can potentially undertake the development, provided it aligns entirely with the intended purpose. This is elaborated in detail in Tables 4 and 5, where relevant conditions are stated. 



Additionally, an Accommodation Reservation (AR) provision exists, where the owner may develop lands under the specific conditions mentioned hereafter. For further information, refer to Table 5.



Converted Table 4 - Among the reserved lands' categories that should be developed exclusively by MCGM or the Appropriate Authority or by permissible owner usage, each entity or category's specific terms of development are enumerated in Table No. 4 under the theme of public lands development.



Converted Table 5 - Further details pertaining to the development of the reserved lands in line with the intended purpose and under Accommodation Reservation (AR) conditions are meticulously articulated in Table No. 5 within the context of developmental strategies for public lands.


# Detailed Guidelines on Development of Reserved Land for Public Purposes Under Accommodation Reservation (AR) Conditions



The conditions for the development of reserved land under Accommodation Reservation (AR) authorize the landowner to cultivate the land, on condition that he consents to erect a Built-Up Area (BUA) equivalent to 'X' % of the basic zone Floor Space Index (FSI) and agree to surrender it to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or the appropriate authority in place of FSI/Transferable Development Rights (TDR), as particularized in this regulation.



Besides, it permits the landowner to relinquish 'Y' % of the reserved plot's area free of charge following the designs, alliances, terms, and conditions duly authorized by the Commissioner. The landowner is entitled to access the permissible BUA of Y% of the reserved plot for supplementary allowable uses in the zone under these Regulations on the remaining land [(100- ‘Y’) % of the land] as permitted under this principle.



Table No. 5 below depicts the values of 'X' and 'Y' for their pertinent reservations as mentioned in Sr. No. i and ii in the conditions to develop reserved land under Accommodation Reservation (AR).



This regulation also allows the development of a constructed built-up amenity meeting all requirements per these Regulations to the MCGM along with the land as stated earlier under AR, in an independent building or semi-detached to the structures of other permissible development on the same plot proposed by the landowner/developer on the surviving land. The MCGM shall be the legally recognized owner of such a plot along with BUA.



Post-development, the owner/developer is required to make an application to the Revenue Authority for rectification of records or mutation entry. After this, the Commissioner will engage the Revenue Department for necessary mutation entry actions. Following such an application, the Revenue Department should process a mutation entry of the plot along with BUA handed over to MCGM in another rights column and correct the revenue records accordingly upon receipt of such communication and on the payment of certain fees by the owner as determined by the Government. Prior to seeking an Occupation Certificate for any part of the building, surpassing 75% of permissible BUA per Zonal (basic) FSI, or granting an Occupation Certificate to any part of the building, apart from the amenity, the owner is obligated to present a separate property register card in the MCGM's name, which is ultimately the earliest among the two events.


# Section 17(1) - Rules and Conditions Governing the Development of Reserved Land for Public Purposes



## Preliminary Criteria for Accommodation Reservation (AR) Development 



Reserved land owners have the option to construct a built-up area (BUA) equal to 'X'% of the Basic (Zonal) Floor Space Index (FSI) and commit to transfer ownership to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or the relevant authority in exchange for FSI/TDR, as set forth in this regulation. Moreover, 'Y'% of the reserved plot's area, free of cost, should be relinquished according to designs, specifications, and terms approved by the Commissioner under point 1). 



Alternatively, owners can choose to develop land by adhering to the same 'X'% of Basic (Zonal) FSI for BUA creation but transfer ownership to the MCGM unconditionally, in accord with Table 5's guidelines and after premium payment based on Note 20(i) below Table 5 or as periodically determined by the Government. This arrangement exempts them from the obligation to concede 'Y'% of the reserved plot's area and hinges on them also complying with conditions ii) and iii. 



The BUA designated for handover to the MCGM, including all stipulated requirements, can be developed as a separate building, semi-attached to the existing structures, or within the premises of other permissible developments proposed by the owner/developer, ideally with independent access. The ownership of such handed-over BUA is transferred to the MCGM or the appropriate authority. 



The landowner/developer is then required to apply to the Revenue Authority for a mutation entry, which is initiated by the Commissioner and involves the registration of the BUA transfer to MCGM in property register cards or Revenue records. 



The Revenue Department reports these changes, which are endorsed by the owner through premium payment as set by the Government, and updates the revenue records. The owner has to present the property register card listing the mutation entry before applying for an Occupation Certificate for any part of the building over 75% of the permissible BUA allowed by the Zonal (Basic) FSI. 



The Commissioner has the discretion to designate an appropriate agency to oversee the operation and maintenance of the developed amenity according to prescribed guidelines. 



If proposals were previously approved under prior Regulations' provisions, lands/BUAs should be transferred to MCGM or the relevant authority for public use, as the earlier Regulations dictated. This stipulation is valid even if such reservations, existing amenities, or facilities are not reflected on the Development Plan (DP). The sites are considered to be reservations/existing amenities of the DP and should be developed accordingly.


#  Development Guidelines for Reserved Land for Public Purposes


##  Regulation Conditions for Developing Reserved Land under Accommodation Reservation (AR)



Each construction that is required for the entry and exit of passengers using public mass transit facilities is permitted on any land that is reserved or presently being used for any public purpose. This is approved irrespective of the permissibility given in any land-use classification.

# Section 17(1) - Guidelines for the Development of Reserved Land for Public Uses


## Contextual Conditions for the Modification of Reserved Territory under Accommodation Reservation (AR)



The piece of land to be transferred to MCGM or the relevant authority under the Accommodation Reservation (AR) rules should be deducted from the total land area when calculating the permissible Built-Up Area (BUA), except in cases processed under Regulation No 33(5), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(8), 33(9), 33(9)(A), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(20)(A), and 33(21). The Built-Up Area (BUA) given to MCGM must be exempt from Floor Space Index (FSI) restrictions and the remaining land may be developed according to these regulations, without including the BUA.



The Built-Up Area (BUA) of the staircase, elevator and elevator lobby, as well as the BUA free from FSI as defined in Regulation no 31(1), should not be included in the Built-Up Area (BUA) transferred to MCGM. No premium should be charged for providing the built-up amenity under Accommodation Reservation (AR).



Developers or owners can claim BUA or Transferable Development Rights (TDR) against the cost of constructing the built-up amenity under the AR as per the following rule: The rate of BUA/TDR in lieu of the cost of construction of built-up amenity under AR is calculated by multiplying 1.50 with the ratio of the construction rate per square meter to the developed land rate per square meter as per ASR/Ready Reckoner and the BUA of the constructed amenity under AR.



In the instance of Sr. N0 66 (PPL), the incentive Built-Up Area (BUA) should be equivalent to 50% of the calculated BUA as outlined before. There will be no separate compensation for areas under Regulation No.31(1). The BUA for the elevator, staircase, elevator lobby, and other areas as per Regulation 31(1) should not be added into the BUA allocated to MCGM and should not incur a premium for the built-up amenity under AR.



For the purpose of defining the number of residential units, the ratio of BUA to carpet area should be taken as 1.2. The rate of ASR/Ready Reckoner that applies should be the ASR/Ready Reckoner rate of the year when the IOD/IOA is issued.



The constructed built-up amenity together with the land to be allocated to MCGM under the AR should have provisions for vertical expansion for future utilization of extra permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) in line with these regulations.



Owners/Developers can be awarded Transferable Development Rights (TDR) against unused Built-Up Area (BUA), including that of Zonal (basic) FSI. However, if the land is reserved as per the Development Plan (DP) and the owner wishes to surrender the land without any encumbrances to MCGM or the relevant authority, they will be entitled to the grant of TDR as per Regulation No 32. If the reserved land as per the DP is taken over by MCGM or the relevant authority, the Owner is entitled to a grant of TDR as per Regulation No 32 or a monetary compensation as applicable.


# Detailed Guidelines for the Development of Reserved Land for Public Purposes under Accommodation Reservation (AR)



**Conditions Relating to the Land Owners and Their Responsibilities**



- In relation to the development of reserved land under Accommodation Reservation (AR), the land owner must give advance possession of the property to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or the appropriate authority, as applicable, at the time of seeking development approval.


- All responsibilities for clearing any encumbrances and completing formalities for transferring the land ownership to the MCGM or appropriate authority rest with the land owner.



**Rules about the Area of Built-Up Amenity and FSI**



- In the case of a built-up amenity, it's area is initially counted in the Floor Space Index (FSI). After the shift of the built-up amenity, the area is permissible free of FSI.


- A commencement certificate concerning Built-Up Area (BUA) in exchange for the built-up amenity transferred to MCGM under AR must only be approved after the tale over of the said amenity.



**Information on Compatibility of Principal vs Ancillary Users**



- In scenarios where the primary and ancillary users aren't reflected in the previously mentioned table but are in line with the reservation development, such uses can be permitted with special commissioner approval.



**On Development of Land Reserved for Public Open Spaces**



- For the development of a plot reserved for Public Open Spaces as per items 15,16, 18, 48, and 49 of Table No 5, the provisions of Regulation No.27 might not be applied.


- In cases where a reserved plot under Sr No.1 of Table No 5 (Municipal School) is completely developed and operated by a private owner, conditions, including admissions, set by the Municipal Commissioner will apply.



**Acquisition of Notified or Reserved Private Plots**



- Private plots which are notified by the Government of Maharashtra (GOM) or reserved in the Development Plan (DP) for public transportation authorities like the MRVC, MMRDA, BEST, etc., and specialized public amenities such as National Law University shall allow said authorities to acquire 50% of the plot under AR. The remaining plot will be available for development by the owner in accordance with these regulations.



**Conditions for Social Amenities Received Under AR**



- In the case of social facilities, the built-up comforts received under AR will be provided by the MCGM to the GOM for operation, either via its own departments or other institutions, exclusively for the intended purpose.



**Provisions for Development of Unreserved Plots and Existings Structures**



- Existing lawful structures within the Public Open Spaces (POS), sanctioned by the Competent Authority prior to the implementation of these regulations, will remain protected.


- Existing POS with lawful structures currently encumbering them will be freed of these encumbrances and maintained purely for their intended purpose; these cannot be developed under any redevelopment scheme.


# Guidelines and Conditions for Development of Reserved Land for Public Purposes Under Accommodation Reservation (AR) 



The following provisions outline the conditions that apply to the development of reserved land under Accommodation Reservation (AR). Should any development affect a plot under AR reservation, where an authority apart from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is involved, a No Objection Certificate/remarks from the concerned authority is indispensable before permitting development under AR. A list of relevant authorities can be found in Annexure 24. 



Playgrounds attached to educational and medical institutions, museums, or trusts, and under the same ownership are not subject to acquisition. These existing playgrounds, indicated as such in the Development Plan (DP), are allotted exclusively for the use of the respective institution or trust. 



Public open spaces in K/E Ward are subject to guidelines from the Government of Maharashtra's Urban Development Department, as per notification no TPB 4392/4716/CR-181/92/UD-11(RDP) dated 12.11.1992. Half of the lands from specific CTS Nos and certain parts of Village Sahar are reserved for park development, while the remaining 50% is designated for hotel and commercial purposes, given that the parties develop and maintain the parks for public use during specific hours. Alternatively, landowners may hand over 20% of this area to the MCGM as a permanent park or playground for public use without any compensation requirement. No additional Floor Space Index (FSI), Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), or compensation in any form is permissible for the permanently open park area, even if it is handed over to the MCGM.



'Green belt (ROS 2.7)' areas are not treated as reservations. Instead, these are areas of restriction and do not come under acquisition. Similarly, playground reservations or existing playgrounds linked to educational institutions, displayed as reservations in the DP, and belonging to such institutions are not open to acquisition. As per policy, they must be available for public use and must also serve as a 40% required playground for the existing educational institutions.



If the land is developed as per accommodation reservation and the land, together with the built-up amenity, is transferred to the MCGM or a suitable authority, the plot area, along with the built amenity, is considered an existing amenity in the DP, and the remaining land of the owner is included in the land use zone. Additionally, if the development is composite and it's not feasible to hand over part of the land to MCGM, the entire area will be marked as an existing amenity with a '+' sign indicating other uses on the said plot.


#  Development of Reserved Lands for Public Purposes under Section 17(1)


##  Conditions for the development of land under the principle of Accommodation Reservation (AR)



Each usage of Reserved Land for public purposes has to meet specific conditions. If constructing an independent building is unfeasible due to the land reservation's inadequate size or the inability to allocate individual plots with public amenities, the Municipal Commissioner has the authority to approve composite building development on the land. This is subject to the stipulation that the developed area should preferably be handed over to the Planning Authority or Appropriate Authority, ideally on the ground floor. However, should this floor be used for parking, the developed area can be transferred on the stilt/first floor with distinct public street entry and exit points.



The cost for this type of development is subject to a premium that varies depending on the Floor Space Index (FSI) of the land. Specifically, it costs 35% or 40% of the Annual Schedule Rates (ASR) of the developed land. The exact premium applies to Affordable Housing (AH) and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R), and other reservations modifications may occur as the government decides.



It's also compulsory for the Municipal Commissioner to execute a registered agreement with the developer or landowner when granting development permission. The final Occupancy Certificate will only be issued after the Planning Authority or Appropriate Authority has taken possession of all fulfilled terms, conditions, and constructed amenities.



The Municipal Commissioner, based on regulatory norms, grants permissions for development of reservations. Beaver, the developed areas handed over to the Planning Authority should be clearly marked on the approved building plans, along with an executed registered agreement.



Following the completion of construction, a transfer deed should be executed for the handed-over amenity, with related costs covered by the owner. The Occupancy Certificate can be issued only after the amenity's transfer to the Planning Authority. Further, the Municipal Commissioner has six months from possession to make the constructed amenity accessible to the general public per deemed fit conditions.



For developments already granted permission under the Accommodation Reservation principle according to prior regulations, the approval will stay valid as per Regulation 9(5) stipulation. However, the Inclusive Housing Regulations and Amenity Space, if any, don't correlate with developing reservations under this specific regulation.


# Section 17(1): Development of Reserved Land for Public Purposes and Applicable Accommodation Reservation (AR) Conditions



Under the regulations for Accommodation Reservation (AR) development, there is no cap on using the remaining plot's permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) as indicated in column 7 of Table 12, regulation 30(A)1. The remaining plot intended for handover to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or an appropriate Authority is not restricted.



The regulations also allow for using in-situ FSI/TDR potential or additional FSI without cap, upon premium payment. This is considered in light of the plot expected for handover to MCGM or an Authority. The parameters apply if the developed reservation transitions into MCGM's ownership within five years, or a government-specified extended duration.



For a reservation area less than or equal to 5 hectares, an additional Built-Up Area (BUA), equivalent to the transferred plot's area, is allowed. Such a provision is available for the MCGM/Appropriate Authority, free of cost and unencumbered. This is in addition to the permissible FSI as per regulation 30(A), excluding proposals under Regulation No. 33(5), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(8), 33(9), 33(9)(A), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(20) (A), and 33(21).



For a reservation area larger than 5 hectares, 50% of the transferred plot's area is permissible as additional BUA. Free-of-charge and without encumbrances, it must be handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority. This follows after gaining government approval and adheres to permissible FSI as per regulation 30(A). It also excludes proposals as detailed in the previous paragraph.



An open space deficiency is chargeable at the higher rate between 10% of the Normal premium or 2.5% of the ASR rate for FSI 1. This is applicable for buildings on the remaining reserved area.



Once approved under these regulations, the owner/developer has a specific timeline (as stated by the Municipal Commissioner) to complete the development and hand over the developed reservation to the Planning Authority. A delay penalty may be imposed by the Municipal Commissioner.



In composite development of Constructed amenity under AR as per Regulation 17(1), the open space deficiency in the owner's share building will be chargeable. The charged rate is either 10% of the normal premium or 2.5% of the RR rate of land as per ASR (for FSI 1), whichever is higher.



The existing amenity may be allowed by the Municipal Commissioner to be managed by the owner. The owner can then develop the remaining site up to the full permissible FSI of the plot under reservation, considering the FSI utilized for the amenity building construction.


#  Conditions for Accommodation Reservation (AR) Development of Reserved Land Intended for Public Purposes



Under certain unique cases, when clear and evident hardship is experienced and it's impossible to develop and handover individual plots replete with built amenities, the Municipal Commissioner might permit composite development on the designated land. The key condition for this allowance is that the built-up area, referred to above, is to be developed or transferred to the Public Authority, ideally in a separate structure, wing, on the ground floor, or as part of a composite building. For cases where the ground floor is allocated for parking, then the structure should be on stilts or above floors, each with their distinct entry and exit points from the public street. The Municipal Commissioner retains the right to recover 40% of the land area's cost calculated based on the prevalent Ready Reckoner Rate, in line with the policy of the Municipal Corporation.



The parcel of land identified as C. S. no 831 within the Mazgaon Division, also known as India United Mill No 2 & 3, has been officially notified and reserved for use as a 'Recreation Ground cum Textile Museum.' This reservation was confirmed under Notification No TPB4312/789/CR-27/2013/UD-11, dated 29th December 2016. The development of this piece of land is to be completed in accordance with the specifications identified in the said Notification.

Existing cinema or theater can be redeveloped adhering to the rules stated in these Regulations. The conditions permit the redevelopment of these establishments with certain constraints:



- The redevelopment of an existing cinema or theater on an allocated plot may integrate cinema or theater operations with permissible residential or commercial uses, barring exceptions such as bakeries, confectioneries, coal and firewood shops, maternity homes, hospitals, schools, trade schools, and colleges.


- The redevelopment can also accommodate cinema or theater operations that offer seating capacities of at least 33% of the last licensed number of seats in the existing establishment, ensuring a minimum of 150 seats. This capacity may be subject to change as decided by GOM.


- In cases where the existing cinema or theater has more than 600 seats as stated in the last license, the redevelopment should include at least 200 seats without insistance on the provision of 33% of the last licensed seating capacity.


- The Built-Up Area (BUA) of the redeveloped theater should not exceed the zonal (basic) FSI, and should be within the overall permissible FSI as detailed in column 7 of table 12. No premium will be charged for this BUA.


- One-screen cinemas or theaters can be converted into multiplexes, given they adhere to the stated conditions and regulations.


- If a cinema or theater is developed alongside other non-residential uses in a single building, the open space requirement should be as required for the special building. Residential uses may be permitted in a separate building or wing with individual access.



Alternatively, the owner or developer can opt for constructing public entertainment facilities like Drama theatre, Opera theatre, Mini-theater, Multiplex, Art Gallery, Video Hall, Library, Reading rooms, Hall for Musical events, Experiment Theatre, Children Theatre, Acting Schools, or Preview Theatre, among others, with ancillary uses.



In another possibility,



i) The plot of the cinema or theater can be developed on par with AR. For plots up to 2000 sq. m, 40% of BUA as per Zonal (basic) FSI can be built. For plots exceeding 2000 sq. m, 40% of the plot & built-up amenities equivalent to 50% of the Zonal (basic) FSI of the plot should be freely handed to MCGM. The Built-up amenities should preferably be dedicated to public entertainment, such as Opera theater, Mini-theater, Production studio for cinema & or Tele-serial, Dubbing & Recording studio, Preview theater, and should be located in a separate wing with separate access for plots up to 2000 sq.m.


# Detailed Guidelines for Redevelopment of Existing Cinemas/Theaters under Regulation 17(2)



#### Provision for Development of Remaining Potential



The owner retains the right to develop the remaining potential of the existing Cinema/Theater in accordance with Regulation No 17(1). This regulation allows for permissible uses in residential and commercial zones. It's worth noting that the usage rights extend to residential purposes, however, this is under the provision that such residential purposes are served in a structure separate from the main building.



#### Entitlement for Development of Balance Plot



The owner also holds entitlement for the continuation of the development of any balance plot related to the existing Cinema/Theater. This entitlement comes directly from the provisions laid out in these regulations, allowing for the further refinement and extension of the property according to the rules.


# Regulation 17(3): Development provisions for Reserved Land under Regulation No. 33



Regulation 17(3) states that despite anything stated in these regulations, the development of reserved land falling under the various stipulations of Regulation No. 33 shall follow the outlined principles.



## Development of Reservation in Development or Redevelopment of Housing Schemes by MHADA under Regulation No. 33(5)



Point (A) of Regulation 17(3) clarifies that all reservations within the development or redevelopment of housing schemes overseen by MHADA must be developed entirely for the purpose they've been originally intended for, under the stipulations of Regulation No. 33(5). This is integral to promoting transparency and integrity in the development processes.


# Detailed Exploration of Regulation No. 33 - Development and Redevelopment of Reserved Land and Buildings 


Under the directive of Regulation No. 17(3), the development of land, which falls under the different conditions of Regulation No. 33, follows specific rules. 



## Development Regulations for Reserved Land and Cessed Buildings


Accommodation concerning the reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies is permissible. Similarly, the redevelopment of old structures owned by the Corporation under the jurisdiction of Regulation No. 33(7) is allowed. 



Redevelopment or reconstruction in evolving area categories doesn't necessitate the change of zones. For industrial users, it is required to keep the established segregating distance from any present industrial unit. 



In the incident of land-redevelopments possessing stopped structures and reservations in the Development Plan (DP), the land component of these stopped structures, according to the basic Floor Space Index (FSI) principles, are considered automatically removed from reservations. 



For Corporation-owned building reconstructions or redevelopments, the Built-Up Area (BUA) equivalent to 25% of the plot area, per basic FSI, must be made available to MCGM. The developer is entitled to BUA in exchange for construction costs against building amenities as per note (d) of Regulation 17(1). 



The Corporation holds the authority to reconstruct or redevelop buildings dating back to 30.09.1969. They have the right to clear any plot with an area measuring up to 500 square meters that have non-buildable/open space reservations by transferring the current occupants.



## Conditions for Specific Structures and Sites


The redevelopment of certain sites with non-buildable/open space reservations or cemeteries is subject to conditions stipulating the area of sites and land components of existing structures. 



Existing structures on land reserved for Municipal School (RE 1.1), Primary and Secondary School (RE1.2), or Higher Education (RE2.1) have conditions to be adhered to during redevelopment.


# Regulation 17(3): Provisions for Development of Reserved Lands under Regulation No. 33



## Subsection B: Framework for Redevelopment of Reserved Land in Island City



Regarding the redevelopment of reserved land in the context of reconstruction or rebuilding cessed buildings in the Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies or of old buildings owned by the Corporation. This falls under Regulation No. 33(7).



1. With respect to land earmarked for Municipal School (RE 1.1), Primary and Secondary School (RE1.2) in the development plan, a structure to house no fewer than 500 students is required, as determined by the Municipal Commissioner. The constructed building's utilizable area will not be counted for FSI computation, allowing for redevelopment according to this regulation.



2. Pertaining to lands designated for Higher Education (RE2.1) in the development plan, a suitable infrastructure for no less than 800 students should be put in place, as per the Municipal Commissioner's discretion. The built-up area of the facility will not factor into the FSI calculation, subsequently leading to permissible redevelopment in accordance with the given regulation.



3. As for plots reserved for Parking Lots, construction of the built-up area should exceed the basic FSI of the reserved region by 125%.



4. Existing infrastructures on lands designated for Rehabilitation & Resettlement (RR 2.1) are to be considered as potential development sites for such structures, with redevelopment specified according to this regulation.



5. For all types of buildable reservations, not included in types (ii),(iii), (iv) & (v) listed above and mentioned as part of table no 4 of Regulation No 17(1), built-up area equivalent to 25% of the reserved area in the respective plot must be constructed.


# Section 17(3): Development Provisions for Reserved Land under Regulation No. 33 and its Sub-regulations



The following details elaborate on the development of reserved land as defined in Regulation No. 33 of the building codes and regulations:



## Sub-section [C] (I): Cluster Development Scheme for Building Reconstruction



- Regardless of the zone, reconstruction or redevelopment is permitted without the requirement for a change-of-zone procedure. For industrial users, it's essential to maintain the current segregating distance from the existing industrial units.


- In the case of non-buildable or open space reservations less than or equal to 500 sq. m., existing tenants may be relocated to clear the land.


- For any land greater than 500 sq. m. falling under non-buildable/open space reservations, a minimum of 50% of the reserved area should be developed for the same purpose and handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), provided it's at least 500 sq. m. The remaining land may be developed accordingly.


- All reservations in the Development Plan (DP) may require rearrangement, subject to maintaining the same access road width and area or those specified under Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR), whichever is larger.


- For parking lot reservations in a Cluster Development Scheme (CDS), 125% of Built-Up Area (BUA) based on Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) should be made available to MCGM or another relevant authority at no cost, excluding FSI.


- For any other buildable reservations, BUA equivalent to 60% Zonal (basic) FSI or existing BUA, whichever is greater, must be offered to MCGM or the suitable authority free of FSI and cost. Composite development of reservations may be permitted. However, if HPC/Planning Authority demands BUA exceeding the Zonal (basic) FSI, the excess area is considered as rehabilitation FSI with incentive FSI permissible under this regulation.


- In cases of Rehabilitation & Resettlement reservations development under CDS, 30% of BUA per Zonal (basic) FSI is required to be handed over to the MCGM free of FSI and cost, in addition to any existing tenement rehabilitation.


- In cases of Corporation building reconstruction/redevelopment on plots without reservation or designated for Municipal Housing, 30% of the plot area BUA based on Zonal (basic) FSI must be made available to MCGM. The developer is entitled to BUA against construction cost for handing over of built-up amenity as per Note (d) of Regulation No. 17 (1), in case of clause(e) & (f).





# Detailed Guidelines for Development of Reserved Lands under Regulation No. 33(17)(3)


This segment is focused on the development guidelines of reserved lands falling under the provisions of Regulation No. 33, particularly regulation 33(17)(3).



## Development Provisions for Cluster Development Scheme under Regulation No. 33(9)


Under Regulation No. 33(9), a development of reservation in reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of buildings is possible via the Cluster Development Scheme. Where a proposed DP Road or Regular line of street exists within the Urban Development Scheme area, using the entire Floor Space Index (FSI) admissible for the road area is permitted within the same scheme. Furthermore, we can rearrange the location and area under DP road or existing roads based on a comprehensive traffic study without affecting current traffic movement or reducing the existing road and DP Road's total area. Realignment or relocation of existing roads is permissible as per the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act provisions.



## Regulation for the Fungible Compensatory Area under Regulation No. 33


Under Regulation No. 33, there is a provision that no premium should be charged for the fungible compensatory area under Regulation 31(3). This area pertains to the rehabilitation component of a Cluster Development Scheme sanctioned by the High Power Committee (HPC), tenements handed over to Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and, areas of reservation handed to Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MCGM) or an appropriate authority. However, usage of the admissible fungible compensatory area to the rehabilitation tenements for Sale Component in the Urban Development Scheme is not allowed. It is only permissible for rehabilitation component use.



## Encroachment Rehabilitation in Unbuildable Reservation under Regulation No. 33


Despite anything stated in these regulations, if a slum is located on fully occupied, unbuildable reservation land, the option exists for the owner/developer to rehabilitate the existing slum dwellers within the same or adjoining municipal ward. This rehabilitation requires the consent of slum dwellers and should be done at the owner's/developer's expense, with no compensation. Following the resettlement, the entire land under reservation must be handed over to MCGM with no compensation. Subsequently, it is permissible to utilise the permissible Floor Space Index of this land within the cluster area. However, under these regulations or Regulation No. 33(10), no concession is allowed for buildings where slum dwellers are rehabilitated.


# Regulation No. 33 - Development Parameters for Reserved Land and Urban Renewal Schemes



In the context of Regulation No. 33, it is essential to understand the guidelines for handling development and redevelopment of reserved lands falling under various provisions. This includes regulations pertaining to the reconstruction or redevelopment of BDD chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi. These are typically enveloped under Urban Renewal Scheme(s), further articulated under Regulation No. 33(9)(B).



Even amidst the regulations, the development, demolition or recommencement of buildings falling within the constraints of the Development Plan is permissible. Notably, redevelopment or reconstruction within any established zone can be conducted without the need to alter the zone. This, however, mandates that the segregating distance from existing industrial units is maintained for industrial users.



Relevant to non-buildable reservations, lands not exceeding 500 sq. m can be sanitized by relocating existing tenants. If the land under reservation is larger than 500 sq. m., at least 50% of this land should be developed for the same purpose and ceded to the Planning Authority, guaranteeing a minimum of 500 sq. m. The remaining land can subsequently be developed.



The established reservations in the Development Plan could be rearranged or relocated when necessary. This would still maintain the same area proportion and road access width as required under the DCPR or exceed if present conditions warrant.



In terms of parking lots reservation within URC, the BUA equivalent to the Zonal (basic) FSI on the reserved land will be freely handed over to the Officer appointed by the Planning Authority. This given BUA is free of FSI.



All other buildable reservations on land will contribute a built-up area equal to 60% of the Zonal (basic) FSI under such reservations or existing built-up area of the amenity, whichever is greater. This will be provided free of FSI and free of cost to the Planning Authority. In cases of such reservations, the vacant plot of DP reservation may be allowed for residential development if the BUA of DP reservation is amalgamated and built on one or more block/plot. However, if the Empowered Committee requires additional BUA under any designation/reservation exceeding the Zonal (basic) FSI, this excess area will be treated as rehabilitation F.S.I, and Free sale FSI under this Regulation will be allowed.



If a proposed Development Plan Road or Regular line of street passes through the Urban Renewal Scheme area, the entire FSI allowable under these Regulations for the area of the road can be introduced in the same Scheme.


# Regulation 17(3): Provisions for Development of Reserved Lands including Regulation No. 33 Exceptions



## Sub-Regulation (D): Redevelopment of Reservations for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under Regulation No.33(10)



The lands categorized as slums which fall under the Residential or Commercial Zones and are impacted by the reservation in the Development Plan (DP) should be developed adhering to the following stipulations:



1. Any plot or layout classified as non-buildable/open space reservations with a total area up to 500 square meters must be cleared by relocating the inhabitants of the slum dwelling. 



2. For sites with non-buildable/open space designation that exceed an expanse of 500 square meters, these may be eligible for slum redevelopment. This is provided the used ground area of the land does not exceed 65% of the total reservation, ensuring that 35% remains clear afterwards for reservation purposes. 



## Provisions for Existing Slum Structures on Lands Reserved for Educational Institutions



According to the guidelines, existing slum structures established on lands preserved for Municipal School (RE 1.1)/ Primary and Secondary School (RE1.2) or Higher Education (RE2.1) can be developed subject to specific instructions. 



- For the land assigned for Municipal School (RE 1.1) or Primary and Secondary School (RE1.2), the property owner or developer must construct an institution capable of housing an established number of students determined by the Municipal Commissioner, but not less than 500 students. These buildings should be constructed as per the size, design, specification, and conditions prescribed by the Municipal Commissioner. 



This construction will be exempted from Floor Space Index (FSI) computation. Once it completes, this portion intended for school use should be handed over to the corporation free of charge. After this transfer, the remaining land can be redeveloped utilizing the full permissible FSI of the plot, as specified in this Regulation.



- For lands reserved for Higher Education (RE2.1), the owner or developer should erect a building capable of accommodating a certain number of students, as decided by the Municipal Commissioner, but not less than 800 students. 



Again, the constructed structures will be removed from the FSI computation. The completed and commissioned educational building must be handed over to the corporation free of charge. The Municipal Commissioner can then entrust the transferred property or a part thereof intended for school use to a recognized educational institution for maintenance and operation. After this process, the land can be redeveloped with the whole allowable FSI of the plot consistent with this Regulation.


# Detailed Explanation of Section 17(3) Notwithstanding Provisions: Development Guide for Reserved Lands in Regulated Areas



## Development of Reserved Land under Regulatory Provisions



According to the provisions defined under Regulation No. 33 in Section 17(3), the development of reserved land is to be performed as follows:



- If the area reserved for a Municipal School (RE 1.1) or Primary and Secondary School (RE1.2) or a Higher Education institution (RE2.1) spreads across an adjoining plot, the Commissioner may insist on construction proportionate to the reservation area, with special consent. This construction need not adhere to the playground requirements dictated under Regulation No 38 (I) (2). 


- For other buildable reservations except these schools and Higher Education institutions on lands under the slum, BUA equivalent to 20% percent of the reservation area in the plot shall be demanded free of cost by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority for the Municipal Corporation or any other suitable authority. 


- In cases where the plot is reserved for a parking lot, 125% BUA as per Zone's basic FSI of such reserved area will be transferred to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). 


- The developer or owner is allowed to receive Built-Up Area (BUA) matching the cost of construction when handing over the built-up amenity as per note (d) of Regulation 17(1) in the case of clause 3, 4 & 5 above. 


- The boundaries of existing slums, excluding non-slum areas or canals, certified by a Competent Authority on lands reserved for Rehabilitation & Resettlement (RR 2.1) are considered development sites for slum structures. Redevelopment in these areas is allowed according to this regulation. 


- Reserved areas beyond the boundary of the slums on open land, non-slum areas, or canals have to be developed entirely for their original intended purpose.



## Legacy Cases and Conversion Rules in Land Development



In situations where Letters of Intent or Initial Offer Agreements (LOI/IOA) were previously issued by the CEO of Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) before the sanctioned Development Plan (DP) 2034 was implemented, the reservations as per the Slum Rehabilitation & Development Project (SRDP) 1991 would continue to be in force. These will operate under the Development Control Regulation (DCR) 1991, even after the approval of DP 2034 and their developments will proceed according to DCR 1991.



For conversions or revisions of LOI as per this regulation, and in cases where the plot is reserved for different or the same public interests with an equal or higher reserved area in DP 2034 than DP 1991, then the development shall follow this regulation. The DP road will be reckoned according to DP 2034.


# Detailed Interpretation of Regulation 17(3): Development of Reserved Lands Under Regulation No. 33 for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers 



This segment is primarily centred around Regulation No. 33, subpart (10), labelled as Development of reservation in Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under Regulation No.33(10) within the parent document. 



## Subcommittee [D]: Slum Rehabilitation in Industrial Zones



Industrial zones that harbour slums may undergo redevelopment. Remarkably, this can be achieved without altering the existing zoning category. Notably, the free-sale component must embrace all customary uses the original zone permits, even if residential uses form part of the framework.



Regarding industrial applications, a minimum distance must be maintained from any existing industrial units. This phrase is presented as For industrial uses, the segregating distance shall be maintained from the existing industrial unit.



## Exception for Specific Plot Layouts 



An exception exists for plots or layouts that exclude the area under DP Rad/ prescribed RL according to the MMC Act. These areas can be developed under this regulation, with the caveat that the holder hands over 35% of the required amenity, as demanded by Regulation No. 14(B)(c). 



## Guideline for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS)



The segment emphasizes the requirement for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS), which must align with the provisions outlined in Regulation No. 27(1)(a).



## Provisions for DP Reservations



The clauses clarify that if a DP-hosted reservation exists on a plot proposed for development under Regulation No 33(10), the following provisions are applicable: 



1. When the DP reserved area to be transferred to MCGM falls short of the amenity's required built-up land component, only the further land area required must be provided.


2. If the DP-reserved area set for MCGM transfer surpasses the occupancy's obligatory built-up amenity, no additional provision for the amenity is essential.



## Responsibilities of Land Owners and Developers



Landowners must offer preliminary possession of the land, where applicable, to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai/MCGM or the suitable authority while applying for plot development approval. It stands as the landowner's responsibility to remove all encumbrances and facilitate land transferring formalities to MCGM or the relevant authority. The layout for the possession receipt mirrors that of Appendix V.



There are rules regarding the counting of built-up amenities in the Floor Space Index (FSI). The developer is liable for the construction cost of all buildable amenities in accordance with Regulation 17(1) Note (d). Furthermore, rules are specified for Commencement Certificates in relation to the built-up amenity.


# Metro Station Interchanges and Land Development Regulations Outlined in Provision 17(3) 



In accordance with the regulations, Development of Reserved land falling under the various provisions of Regulation No. 33, it should be noted that these guidelines apply notwithstanding any other information contained within them.



## Regulation Application on Metro Station Interchanges 



Specific to Metro Station interchanges, the building reservations, if any, on plots adjoining these interchanges are to be nullified on the identification of such interchanges within a 500-meter radius. This nullification is only to that extent, subject to a condition.



## Specification of Indispensable Parking Reservations



The stipulated condition accentuates that 20% of the plot area is to be mandatorily kept reserved for a parking lot. This lot can be established under the 'accommodation reservation policy' as defined by regulation 17(1).



## Enactment of Open Spaces Reservations



The direction further clarifies that non-buildable reservations, specifically denoting open spaces, ought to be executed to their full extent as underlined in the regulation 17(3).


#  Requirements for Building Construction Site Selection



The site selection criteria for any kind of building construction put major emphasis on avoiding any location that the Commissioner deems unsanitary, dangerous for construction or without probable access to water supply within a reasonable timeframe. 



If the prospective construction site is within 6.0 m from the edge of a minor watercourse's watermark or 15m from a major watercourse's watermark, arrangements to drain the flow of the watercourse must satisfy the Commissioner. Although, for low-lying lands without well-defined banks through which a watercourse passes, the Commissioner might allow the property owner to restrict or alter the course of the water.



For trained nallahs, maintaining a 6.0m marginal open space is mandatory. 



Any site proposed for buildings and previously filled with carcasses, excreta, or offensive matter must obtain a certificate from the Commissioner attesting its hygienic suitability for construction. 



Sites that in the Commissioner's opinion, could pose potential health and safety risks to the neighbouring inhabitants, are unfit for construction. 



The selected site’s level should not be lower than the prescribed Datum Level by the Commissioner depending on topography and drainage aspects, which must not be less than a reduced level of 27.55m of the Town Hall Datum.



Construction is prohibited on any site situated within the funnel of vision marked on the D Ward DP plan. 



Also, the building should be situated no closer than 24.5 m for residential buildings and 36.5 m for other buildings from the centerline of a National Highway, State Highway, or Major District Road. 



Building construction is not recommended within 2438 m from an international civil airport or 1829 m from any other civil airport unless consent is obtained from Civil Aviation Authorities.



If the site is designated for places of public worship, the Commissioner and the Commissioner of Police must approve it beforehand. The selected site must also have access from an authorized street/ means of access as per these regulations.



Furthermore, for industrial uses other than service industry locations, an application must be accompanied by the NOC from the government's Industries Department officer, in accordance with the prevailing Industrial Location policy.



Last but not least, any proposed development that might cause harm, have a negative impact on, or is against the urban aesthetics of the environment, ecology, or historical/architectural/aesthetic buildings and precincts is not allowed unless otherwise specified by these regulations.


# Section 19: Guidelines for Public Street Access and Building Heights



## Rule 1: Access to Every Site Must be Unobstructed 


Each site that is intended to be developed or redeveloped is mandated to have access from a public street or road in accordance with these regulations. It is crucial that this access should remain free of encroachment.



## Rule 2: Access to High Rise and Special Buildings 


The Commissioner possesses the authority to authorize access to such buildings from any street, as outlined in the subsequent table, Table No. 6.



## Detailed Specifications in Table No 6 : Required Minimum Road Width in Metres (m) for Different Building Types and Heights



- For a HighRise building with a height ranging from Above 32m upto 70 m, the minimum road required should be more than 9.0 m in width.


- For a HighRise building with a height ranging from Above 70m upto 120 m, the minimum road required should be more than 12.0 m in width.


- For a HighRise building with a height Above 120m, the minimum road required should be more than 18.0 m in width.


- For a Special or Assembly Building with the height up to 32m, the minimum road required should be more than 12.0 m in width.


- For a Special or Assembly Building with the height above 32m, the minimum road required should be more than 18.0 m in width.


# Chapter 19: Public Street and Means of Access Policies



## Continuation of Street and Access Connection Guidelines



The policy mandates that one end of a street should connect to another street of similar or greater width. For buildings reaching up to a maximum height of 70 meters, the Commissioner is provided the discretionary power to permit access through two numbers of existing roads each at minimum width of 6.0 meters. Yet, no concessions should be allowed in front open space, maintaining the total front open space inclusive of road width a minimum of 9 meters. In addition, the 6 meter road needs to connect to a street with a width of at least 9 meters.



For reconstruction projects under Regulation 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(7)(B), 33(10), and 33(10)A, the standard width of 9 m is deemed adequate for buildings with a maximum height of 120m, and 13m width for any structure above 120m. Such provisions must be approved by the CFO's NOC.



## Guidelines for Creating a Technical Committee for High-Rise Buildings



The Municipal Commissioner shall constitute a Technical Committee to offer advice for high-rise buildings that possess a height exceeding 120 meters or any building with a slenderness ratio of 9 or more, regardless of the building's height. This committee shall comprise the following:



- A retired IAS officer of at least Principal Secretary rank as chairman


- A Structural Engineering faculty from IIT/VJTI/SPCE as a member 


- A Soil Mechanics faculty from IIT/ VJTI/SPCE as a member


- A practicing registered structural engineer with a minimum experience of 10 years in structural designing as a member 


- The Chief Fire Officer, MCGM as a member


- An optional technical member



The Terms of Reference (TOR), including the duration of the Committee, are subject to the Municipal Commissioner's discretion.



## Road Width Conversion and Acquiring as Public Road



MCGM is required to convert all roads less than 9 meters wide to at least 9 meters or more depending on site conditions as per MR&TP Act or MMC Act. Roads, excluding existing public roads or municipal roads reflected in DP, won't be recognized as public roads until declared under an appropriate section of the MMC Act & thus won't be subjected to acquisition.



## Access Permissions for Other Buildings



The Commissioner has the authority to permit building access from streets not less than 6.0 meters wide, over which the public has a customary right of access or has used or traversed for an uninterrupted period of 12 years. The Commissioner can also grant access from existing streets wider than 3.6 meters, proposed for widening in the DP or sanctioned under the MMC Act of 1888. This also includes streets less than 3.6 meters in regions like gaothan/Koliwada/Adivasipada, given the plot boundary is shifted 2.25m from the street's center line. This condition applies exclusively to identified streets of Traffic Circulation System in gaothan/Koliwada/Adivasipada as approved by the Municipal Commissioner.


# Detailed Guidelines on Access to Public Street and Other Means in Various Areas



This section continues with the exploration of the rules and considerations pertaining to public street access and other means of access in different contexts. In certain cases, particularly in Gaothan, Koliwada, and Adivasipada areas, the existing access is deemed adequate, under the precondition of physical verification on-site. 



Moreover, for any street or road that exceeds 52.0 metres in width and has been specifically identified in the Development Plan (DP) intended for providing direct access, this approach is subject to exceptions if a No Objection Certificate (NOC) has been granted by the relevant road authorities. Thus, this brings forth the intersection of regulatory compliance and urban planning in a nuanced context.


# Section 19: Public Street and Access Routes Specifications


This section focuses on the regulations that apply to plots or buildings that either abut or front access routes.



## Regulation Concerning Plots or Buildings Abutting or Fronting Access Routes


The regulation highlights that whenever a plot or building fronts or abuts an access route, the width of the route's access has to conform to the specifications defined in Regulation No 23. 



As specified earlier, for any plot or building that abuts or fronts an access route, it is a mandatory regulation to observe the access width as outlined in Regulation No 23.


# Detailed Guidelines on the Alignment and Intersection of Roads under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, 1888



In the event of a discrepancy between the width prescribed in the Development Plan (DP) and the outcome of instituting a Regular Line for a street as per the MMC Act 1888, the larger measurement should be considered. This condition reinforces that when a conflict arises in both width measurements specified by the DP and that obtained from the Regular Line under the MMC Act 1888, the larger dimension prevails.



Additionally, certain settings may witness a difference in the alignment of a DP Road and the Regular Line sanctioned by the MMC Act 1888, even if they have the same width. In such cases, the alignment according to the Regular Line gains precedence, indicating a favored application of Regular Line rules under the MMC Act 1888 when alignment variances occur.



When encountering intersections of roads, special adjustments such as rounding off, cut-off, splaying, or use of other similar treatments should be performed to ensure satisfactory operation, which ultimately rests on the Commissioner's approval. This procedure is to comply depending on the widths of the roads, generated traffic, sighting angle, and other factors, in order to provide a clear side distance.



The exact alignment of roads and their intersections should conform to an onsite demarcation led by the Commissioner, demonstrating the Commissioner's responsibility in actual road and junction layout.



Lastly, for accessing a property at the Carriage Entrance, it is crucial to have a sloping part designated for transferring vehicular access from the carriage-way towards the plot. It should be noted, this provision should occur entirely within the bounds of the property. This requirement highlights the necessary provision for a sloping portion for vehicular access from the carriage-way, located within the premise of the property.


# Detailed Insights into Highway and Wider Roads Regulations



As per the specifics of highway and wider roads regulations, sites proposed for highway amenities such as petrol pumps, motels, or hospitals are not permitted to have direct access from a highway or a specified road that is 52m or more in width. This will only be allowed if the Appropriate Authority permits it. 



However, there is a regulation that does not apply to any lawful development that had been granted prior authorized access to highways and other specified roads. These are developments that have existed before the regulations came into effect. It is mandatory for such developers to provide alternative measures to ensure the continuance of their operations.


# Detailed Examination of Access Provisions to Land-Locked Plots



## The Predicament of Land-Locked Plots



A land-locked plot is essentially a plot of land that is completely surrounded by other plots, offering it no direct access to any street or road. This may pose significant challenges to the owner of such a plot, as the lack of access may hinder the plot's use or development.



## Commissioner's Intervention in Providing Access to Land-Locked Plots



The Commissioner holds the authority to enforce provision of access to a land-locked plot through an adjoining plot or plots. This scenario is considered when the adjoining plots are as close as possible to a public street, aiming to provide the most viable access route to the land-locked plot.



## Cost Implications Pertaining to Access Development for Land-Locked Plots



The financial responsibility of acquiring the land needed for access and subsequent development falls upon the land-locked plot's owner. This cost will be borne following the guidelines and conditionalities ordained by the Commissioner.



## Alternate Solutions for Access to Land-Locked Plots via Adjoining Plots



An alternative solution to this situation is if the owner of an adjoining plot, which has direct access to a public street, voluntarily offers to provide right of access to the land-locked plot. In such cases, the access may be permitted from the required marginal side open space of the building on these adjoining plots.


# Detailed Specifications for Internal Means of Access Incorporating Minimum Road Width in Relation to the Area Served



The following segment focuses on internal means of access, laying out the guidelines and requirements applicable to plots in various zones based on their area and the length of access required.



## Road Width Specifications for Plots Not Abutting on Streets



It is mandated for plots which do not abut on a street to be situated or fronted on an access road. The width standards and associated requisites of the access road have been explicitly specified for different zones. These zones include residential, commercial, and industrial areas.



### Minimum access road Width for Residential and Commercial Zones based on access road length and plot size



Table 7 provides the width of access for residential and commercial zones, varying according to the plot area to be served.



- An internal access road less than 75 meters, serving a residential or commercial plot area of less than 1500 square meters, should have a access road width of 6 meters.


- An internal access road less than 75 meters, the access road width should be 7.5 meters for plots with an area spanning more than 1500 square meters and up to 4000 square meters.


- An internal access road less than 75 meters, serving plots ranged over 4000 square meters and up to 10000 square meters would necessitate a access road width of 9 meters.


- An internal access road less than 75 meters, a plot area of more than 10000 square meters requires the access road width to be 12 meters.



- An internal access roads longer than 75 meters but not exceeding 150 meters, serving a residential or commercial plot area of less than 1500 square meters, should have a access road width of 7.5 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 75 meters but not exceeding 150 meters, the access road width should be 7.5 meters for plots with an area spanning more than 1500 square meters and up to 4000 square meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 75 meters but not exceeding 150 meters, serving plots ranged over 4000 square meters and up to 10000 square meters would necessitate a access road width of 9 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 75 meters but not exceeding 150 meters, a plot area of more than 10000 square meters requires the access road width to be 12 meters.

- An internal access roads longer than 150 meters but not exceeding 300 meters, serving a residential or commercial plot area of less than 1500 square meters, should have a access road width of 9 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 150 meters but not exceeding 300 meters, the access road width should be 9 meters for plots with an area spanning more than 1500 square meters and up to 4000 square meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 150 meters but not exceeding 300 meters, serving plots ranged over 4000 square meters and up to 10000 square meters would necessitate a access road width of 9 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 150 meters but not exceeding 300 meters, a plot area of more than 10000 square meters requires the access road width to be 12 meters.

- An internal access roads longer than 300 meters, and irrespective of plot size, requires the access road width to be 12 meters.

Provided that in the context of residential layouts, straight cul-de-sacs up to 150 meters long are permissible. Further, an additional distance of 125 meters can be accepted if there is a provision for additional turning space at 150 meters. The end of these roads should be in a higher position than the main road from where they originate. The turning area in all cases should not be under 81 square meters with no dimension being lesser than 9 meters.



### Minimum Road Width for Industrial Zones 



Information regarding the width of access for industrial zones is summarized in Table 8.



- An internal access road less than 100 meters should have a minimum access road width of 9.0 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 100 meters but not exceeding 300 meters, should have a minimum access road width of 9.0 meters.


- An internal access roads longer than 300 meters need to adhere to a  minimum access road width of 15.0 meters.


# Detailed Explanation of Internal Access Means for Commercial, Residential, and Industrial Zones



Under Section 23 and subsection 27(2), the internal means of access for residential, commercial and industrial zones are not just detailed in tables 7 and 8 but twofold explained below:



1. As per the guidelines, the internal access should be clear of marginal open spaces. However, it should not be less than 3 meters from the building line. Providing this clear and specified distancing ensures the safety and accessibility of the building from all angles.



2. According to subsection 27(2), the prescribed widths for internal access may be reduced by 1 meter if the plots are located only on one side of the access. This reduction in width is intended to optimize the use of land while maintaining necessary access points.



3. Moreover, the length of the internal access for these zones should be measured from the point of its origin to the next wider public street it encounters. This measurement guideline aids in ensuring proper vehicle and pedestrian circulation and contributes to the creation of an efficient internal transport network.



In conclusion, these regulations about internal access in residential, commercial and industrial zones aim to maintain a balance between safety, accessibility, and efficient use of available land.


#  Internal Means of Access and Its Regulation.


##  Provisions for Larger Width of Means of Access



The enhancement of general development in any region can necessitate a broader means of access, as per the requirement of the Commissioner, under the Regulations documented in this text. This provision indicates a possibility for the means of access to have a greater width than ordinarily mandated in the existing regulations.


#  The Use and Relevance of Internal Means of Access in Partially Built-Up Plots



Maintaining internal accessibility within partially built-up plots has always been a crucial aspect of urban planning. One prominent consideration to note, as per clause 27(4), is that the adequacy of a 3.6m width access may be regarded as satisfactory if the remaining area to be constructed does not go beyond 5,000 sq.m.



Additionally, if the said access route passes through a built-over arch, it mandates the incorporation of an elevation limit that should not fall under 4.5m. Crucially, in scenarios where the pending construction area is more than 5,000 sq.m, the standard width of the internal access point would then be decided based on clause 27(1) as detailed in Table number 7.


# Detailed Guidelines for Minimum Width of Pathways



The method of accessing a building from a road, street, or other internal access points should be facilitated by a properly paved pathway, as specified in the tables below. The length of this pathway directly correlates with the distance from the furthest plot or building to the interior road as formulated under Regulation No. 23. Alternatively, it could be the distance to an existing road that provides access.



## Dimensions of Pathways for Various Types of Developments



For residential buildings, there are specific requirements to ensure comfortable and safe passage. According to the data from Table No. 9, 



- A residential building's pathway that is up to 50 meters in length should have a width of 3.0 meters.


- If a residential building's pathway length is up to 40 meters, it is mandated to have a width of 2.5 meters.


- For a pathway length of up to 30 meters in residential buildings, the suggested width is 2.0 meters.


- Residential building pathways running up to 20 meters should provide a width of 1.5 meters.



On the other hand, the dimensions for pathways of non-residential buildings are as follows:



- Pathways of non-residential buildings of up to 20 meters in length require a width of 1.5 meters.


- Non-residential buildings with pathway lengths more than and up to 50 meters demand a width of 3.0 meters.



These guidelines should be adhered to in promoting a safe and manageable traffic flow around buildings. This becomes even more pertinent when taking into account the plot of the building or the existing road from which the pathway extends.


# Detailed Description of Constructing and Maintaining Access Points: Requirements and Regulations



**General Requirements of Access Construction and Maintenance**: Access points must be adequately prepared, utilizing materials such as metal, tar, flagstones, or pavement, in order to meet the satisfaction of the Commissioner. Necessary facilities such as sewers, drains, channels, lighting, water supply lines, and tree shading are required to be implemented in the design of these access points. Importantly, each access point must remain clear of encroachments that reduce its width below the minimum requirement as outlined in Regulation No 23, and must be kept in a condition deemed satisfactory by the Commissioner.



**Regulations for Private Streets**: For private streets or other forms of access, if they are not constructed or maintained as stipulated in the initial sub-regulation, or if illegal structures or fixtures are installed, the Commissioner has the right to issue a written notice. This notice instructs the owner or owners of the surrounding premises, that either directly line the street or access point, abut it, gain access through it or benefit from its existence, to abide by the specifications initially set forth. If the owners fail to comply, the Commissioner has the authority to undertake the construction or maintenance tasks and recover the associated expenses from the owners in question.



**Measuring the Length of Access Points**: The length of primary access points is determined by the distance between the furthest plot or building plot and the main street. The length of secondary access points, on the other hand, is calculated by measuring the distance from its starting point to the first broader road it intersects with.


# Detailed Guidelines for Layout, Amalgamation, and Subdivision of Plots 



This segment focuses on circumstances under which a layout, subdivision, or amalgamation of plots is necessary. Requirements vary depending on the plot size and the nature of construction proposed on it.



## Circumstances Justifying Layout or Subdivision/Amalgamation



There are certain instances in which submission of a layout or a subdivision/amalgamation is mandatory:



1. If construction of more than one building (apart from a building accessory to the main structure) is proposed, a layout or subdivision/amalgamation of plots is obligatory. This encompasses scenarios where land houses multiple structures and aids in easier division and distribution of land.


 
2. In the case of major changes in land usage, like the development or redevelopment of a sizable tract of land that includes division or subdivision/amalgamation of plots, it's crucial to provide a layout or subdivision/amalgamation. This ensures a more orderly modification of the existing plot configuration.



3. Lastly, when the land earmarked for development measures 2000 sq. m or more, a layout, subdivision or amalgamation becomes a requirement in any development zone. This holds true irrespective of the region where the development has been sanctioned; it aims to maintain orderliness and provides ease in processing and governing such large-scale construction projects.


# Detailed Discussion on Layout, Amalgamation, and Subdivision of Plots 



Each layout, amalgamation, or subdivision of plots must comprise of subplots that are formed post-subdivision. Not only should these subplots provide access, but they must also carry the Line of Sight (LOS) as required under Regulation No 23 and 27.



Furthermore, these subplots must allot spaces for any necessary ancillary uses stipulated under Regulation No. 24 and 28. They must also integrate all reservations, designations, allocations, road or road widening proposals of the Development Plan (DP), along with the regular lines of streets mandated under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act, 1888. 



This reflects the core essence of designing an organized and systematic plot, amalgamation, or subdivision. 



It is important, however, to note that the Commissioner reserves the right to authorize boundary adjustments in DP Roads/ reserved/ allocated sites within the same holding, without causing any reductions in the respective areas. Such adjustments must uphold the zoning provisions while catering to certain development requirements. 



In all such circumstances, the Commissioner must ensure that the modified shapes of allocated/reserved sites are such that they align with the development regulations. This serves to maintain functional coherence and overall feasibility of the development.


# Detailed Specifications for Layout, Amalgamation, and Subdivision of Land Plots including Different Use Types and Minimum Areas



The standards for minimum plot areas vary according to the different categories of use types for development, as specified under the broader topic of layout, amalgamation, and subdivision of the plot. Specific dimensions are prescribed in accordance to these use types. A representation of these stipulations is presented in Table No. 10.



- In Table No. 10, concerning the layout, amalgamation, and subdivision of plots, the Sr. No 1 refers to Residential and Commercial land use (except those in 2,3 and 4 below). The permissible plot areas and type of development vary. A plot area of 25 sq.m and above but less than 40 sq.m is proposed for Row type development. 



- For Sr. No 1 under the same land use category, a plot area of 40 sq.m and above but less than 125 sq.m is proposed for Row or Semi-Detached development.



- Sr. No 1 category but with a plot area requirement of 125 sq.m and above (with no dimension less than 9.0 m), the type of development can be Row, Semi-detached, or detached.



- Sr. No 2 pertains to plots in Rehabilitation and Resettlement, Slum up-gradation, or Reconstruction schemes. A minimum plot area of 21 sq.m with a minimum width of 3.0 m is recommended for Row developments in these schemes.



- Sr. No 3 entails specifications for petrol filling stations, without service bays, requiring detached types of development. The minimum plot area should be 545 sq.m (with one dimension not less than 16.75 m). For filling stations using only compressed natural gas, the minimum plot area should be 300 sq.m.



- Sr. No 3 specifies for petrol filling stations equipped with service bays, the plot area needs to be a minimum of 1100 sq.m (with one dimension not less than 30.5 m) for a detached type of development.



- Sr. No 4 discusses the infrastructure of cinema theatres and assembly halls. Here, 3 sq.m per seat is required, inclusive of parking specifications. 



- Sr. No 5 outlines provisions for MangalKaryalaya/Public Hall where the plot area should be a minimum of 1000 sq.m.



- For Industrial (I) purposes listed under Sr. No 6, a detached type of development requires a plot area of a minimum of 300 sq.m (with width not less than 15m).





# Detailed Discussion on Layout, Amalgamation, and Subdivision of Plots Including Minimum Plot Areas



## Minimum Plot Areas and Related Points



1. In situations where a recommended DP Road/RL is outlined in an already accepted layout, any imbalance of FSI in subdivided plots attributed to the new proposed DP Road/RL shall be permissible.


2. When dealing with previously contiguous land that has been subdivided by an existing public road, the Owner/Developer may choose to develop by exploiting the total potential of the erstwhile contiguous land - excluding public road - under these Regulations on any subdivided plot on either side of the existing road. This applies where other subplot/plots on the other side of the road is needed by MCGM, subject to certain conditions.


3. The subplot or plots derived from initially contiguous land should not have been part of any layout previously sanctioned before the implementation of these Regulations.


4. If the subplot/plots whose potential is proposed for use on other subplot/plots, it will be devoid of any further potential and shall be given over to the MCGM. Furthermore, the ownership of the same shall be transferred to the MCGM in P.R. Card, cost-free and without any encumbrances, according to the terms and conditions dictated by the Municipal Commissioner.


5. The area of the subplot/plots where the total potential is intended for use should not be less than 50% of the total area of all subplot/plots, disregarding the area of the existing public road.


6. The subplot/plots so surrendered to the MCGM shall be employed for public purposes as may be decided upon by the Municipal Commissioner, MCGM.


7. The Owner/Developer will not be entitled to any monetary reimbursement or TDR of the plot handed over to the MCGM.


8. The minimal area of the subplot/plots of once contiguous land, where the entire potential is planned to be used on the other subplot/plots of the same previously contiguous land, must be at least 2000 square meters.


# **Layout Recreational Ground/Open Spaces (LOS) Provisions in Residential and Commercial Layouts and Plots**



### **Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) Regulations for Different Plot Sizes in Residential and Commercial Zones**



- For plots with an area between 1001 sq. m and 2500 sq. m, 15% of the area should be designated as the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS).


- Plots with an area between 2501 sq. m and 10,000 sq. m should allocate 20% of the area as the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS).


- An area above 10,000 sq. m requires 25% of the land to be used as the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS).



### **Additional Guidelines for Providing Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) in Layouts**



The Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) excludes internal road areas, current amenities, DP road areas, and areas intended for road-widening. Wherever feasible, the LOS should be offered in one location. However, for layout areas above 5000 sq.m, it may be arranged in multiple places, provided at least one space is not less than 1000 sq. m. Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) isn't required for educational institutions with independent playgrounds. 



### **Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) Under Regulation No 33**



Under Regulation No. 33, the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) is either as prescribed by the relevant regulations or as outlined above. In the case of redevelopment schemes under regulation no. 33(5), 33(7) ,33(8), 33(15) and 33(20)(A), the LOS provision may be reduced, but it should maintain a minimum of 10%. For redevelopment proposal under Regulation No 33(5), the existing area of Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) should be retained when it comprises more than 10% of the layout.



### **Minimum Area, Dimensions, and Access for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS)**



The smallest Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) should cover an area not less than 125 sq.m. The minimum dimension should be no less than 7.5 m, and if the average width is less than 16.6 m, the length should not extend more than 2 1/2 times the average width. Every plot designed for a Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) must have an independent access unless directly approachable from every layout building.



### **Ownership and Tree Growth in Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS)**



The ownership of the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) is vested in all property owners for whom the LOS is designated, as stated in a deed of conveyance. Except for the area covered by permissible structures, the LOS should remain permanently exposed to the sky and accessible to all owners and occupants. Trees should be cultivated in the LOS.


# Detailed Provisions and Specifications for Layout and Plot Recreational Ground/Open Spaces (LOS) in Residential and Commercial Layouts



## Tree Planting Guidelines in Recreational Open Spaces (LOS)



* For both residential and commercial layouts, Layout Recreational Open Spaces (LOS) should follow a tree planting rate of five trees per 100 square meters or part thereof. These trees should be evenly distributed across the entire plot. 


* In residential or commercial plots for which LOS is not required, a planting rate of one tree per 100 square meters or part thereof is advised.


* Along the plot boundaries, shrubs combined with grass are advised to be planted between the trees.



## Structures and Uses Permitted in Layout Recreational Open Spaces (LOS)



* In a Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) that exceeds 400 square meters in unit area, building elevated or underground water reservoirs/tanks, electric substations, pump houses, and facilities for in-situ wet waste treatment are allowed. These facilities, however, should not use more than 10% of the LOS area.


* In a larger LOS, specifically those 1000 square meters or more in area (in one piece at one location), structures like pavilions, clubhouses, gymnasiums, swimming pools, and other buildings designated for sports and recreation activities can be built with the Built Up Area (BUA) not surpassing 15% of the total required LOS. The plinth area of these structures is restricted to 10% of the total LOS area and their height should not exceed 8 meters. The structures' height could be increased to 13 meters for accommodating squash or badminton courts.



Additional Provisions:



* The ownership of the LOS structures and its associated facilities should be provided in a conveyance deed and should invest in all the owners whose cumulative holdings require LOS in the layout.


* The proposal for constructing any such structure should come from the owner/society or federation of societies and is meant primarily for the beneficial use of the owners or society members.


* These structures should not be repurposed for any other use other than recreational activities.


* Residual LOS area should be kept open to the sky and should be accessible to all members for recreational purposes.


* The owner/s or societies or federations of societies involved should submit a registered undertaking to the Commissioner accepting the above conditions.


* LOS present in a private layout should be exclusively for the residents of such layouts and should not be subjected to any acquisition by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or the Appropriate Authority. Moreover, the area of existing Recreational Open Space should be maintained by residents of the private layout. 



Note: Further provisions and regulations are specified for other structures and uses permitted in layout open spaces.


# Detailed Layout Description of Recreational Ground/Open Spaces (LOS) in Layout/Plot



## Construction Regulations for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) in Residential and Commercial Layouts



The construction of Solid Waste Management Systems in residential and commercial Layout Recreational Open Spaces (LOS) is mandated to follow the National Building Code of India, specifically Part 9: Plumbing Services, Section 1: Water Supply, Drainage & Sanitation (encompassing Solid Waste Management). According to paragraph 6 of this section, establishments that feature a biodegradable waste treatment plant in the layout LOS should have an area measuring 2000 Sq.mt. or above. Notably, this structure should only occupy within 10% of the overall LOS area.






# Specifying Recreational Space Regulations in Industrial Layouts/Plots



## About Layout/Open Spaces (LOS) in Industrial Plots/Layouts



In any industrial plot measuring 1000 sq. m or more, 15% of the total area should be designated as a Layout/Open Space (LOS). This LOS must be designed for easy access and be strategically placed for convenient usage by employees in the industrial area. 



The LOS should always remain open to the sky and should be accessible to all owners and occupants. A key requirement is the planting of trees: a rate of 5 trees per 100 sq. m of open space, or alternatively, 1 tree per 100 sq. m in other instances. Additionally, shrubs with grass should be planted between trees along the plot's boundary.



## Calculating Area of LOS



When calculating the area of the LOS, any area under DP road, setback, or reservation area meant to be handed over to the appropriate authority should be excluded. At least 60% of the required LOS should be directly on ground level, with at least 50% of this area on natural terrain (mother earth) to facilitate water percolation. Conversely, the remaining 40% of the required LOS could extend beyond the building line on a raised area (podium). The LOS on the ground should not be paved, and the remainder of compound pavement should use perforated paving to facilitate rainwater percolation.



## Providing LOS on a Podium 



The entire LOS may be provided on the topmost podium open to the sky  with certain conditions. A 1.5m wide unpaved distance must be left for tree planting and space should be provided for the maneuvering of firefighting and related equipment. This 1.5m strip will not count towards the required LOS. Parking on this podium LOS is prohibited, and rainwater harvesting must also be incorporated within the podium based LOS.



## Private Recreational Open Space Regulations



Recreational Open Spaces of private layout identified in DP as reservation of POS or existing POS should remain as open spaces and are not subject to acquisition. In these instances, the existing recreational open space must be maintained by the owner, Cooperative Housing Society or federation, as applicable.


# Detailed Analysis of Electric Consumer Substation (CSS) and Distribution Substation (DSS) Land Requirements



This document segment delves into the particulars of electrical consumer substations and distribution substations, focusing on the land provision implications associated with the development or redevelopment of any land, building, or premises. 



## Essential Land Requirements for Consumer Substation (CSS)



A cornerstone of these considerations is understanding the plot area requirements specific to consumer substations (CSS). This is outlined in Table No.11.



- A plot area of up to 1000 square meters does not necessitate any land allocation for a Consumer Substation (CSS) or Distribution Substation (DSS).


- Plots ranging above 1000 square meters and up to 2000 square meters require a maximum land area of 40.00 square meters for CSS/DSS, sufficient for a single Transformer of 8.0m  X 5.0m.


- Plot areas extending beyond 2000 square meters and up to 4000 square meters demand 66.00 square meters for CSS/DSS, accommodating a single transformer of 12.0m X 5.5m.


- Similarly, plots with a size exceeding 4000, up to 20000 square meters, need an area of 143.00 square meters. This provides enough space for two transformers, each of size 13.0m X 5.5m.


- Lastly, for plot areas above 20000 and up to 40000 square meters, a hefty 720 square meters is set aside for CSS/DSS.



The aforementioned specifications embed an integral part of the process, plotting the land allocation roadmap for electrical consumer and distribution substations.


# Detailed Guidelines on Substation Structure and Safety Measures



## 28.1 Safety Precaution Requirements for Substations


In cases where the Compact Substation (CSS) forms a portion of a building, it is essential for it to conform to all the safety measures stipulated by the relevant Electricity Distribution Company and also fulfill the prerequisites outlined by the Chief Fire Officer.



## 28.2 Development and Maintenance of Public Spaces


The assigned public places should be cultivated and preserved by the associated Electricity Distribution Company independently, under the supervision of the Commissioner.



## 28.3 Installation Height and Ancillary Installations


For the installation of mentioned systems, the height demanded by the technical prerequisites of such installations and the accessory installations crucial for successful functioning of the system will be permitted, discarding the height parameter in Floor Space Index (FSI).



## 28.4 CSS Provision and Assessment


The opportunity for Compact Substation (CSS) will not be forced upon by the Electricity Distribution Company in every development. The specialists in the Electricity Distribution Company will measure the need for CSS, taking into account the existing facilities in the neighborhood.



## 28.5 CSS/DSS Construction in Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS)


Compact Substation/Distribution Substation (CSS/DSS) may be authorized to be constructed in Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) in such a manner that the area doesn't exceed the previously defined limit in Regulation No.27.



## 28.6 Ownership and Easement Rights of Substation Space/Land


The ownership of the space or land where the substation is proposed to be constructed should rest with the relevant owner, society, association, or the person deriving the title. Easement rights will be retained by the associated Electric Authority until CSS/DSS remains in existence and functional. 



## 28.7 Sub-Stations Construction in Open Space


The sub-station planned to be created in an open space should be strategically distanced at least 3 meters away from the main building and in a general way that does not impact the required side margin open spaces, prescribed width, internal access, or larger open space. The substation can be allocated in a stilt, podium, or within the building line, adhering to fire safety requirements, or as decided by the Commissioner.


# Detailed Requirements for Plot Area Allocations for Distribution Substations, Receiving Substations and Extra High Voltage Receiving Stations (DSS/RSS/EHVRS)



This section focuses on the plot area requirements and regulations for the construction and development of Distribution Substations, Receiving Substations, and Extra High Voltage Receiving Stations (DSS/RSS/EHVRS). 



## DSS/RSS/EHVRS Plot Area Specifications



For plots with an area above 20,000 and up to 40,000 square meters, a maximum of 721 to 1200 sq.m (as per the requirements of the relevant Electric Authority) is allocated for DSS/RSS development. For plots greater than 40,000 square meters, the maximum area designated for DSS/RSS establishment, as stipulated by the concerned Electric Authority, is 3,500 sq.m. As for Extra High Voltage Receiving Stations (EHVRS), their construction is permissible as per the needs of the electric distribution company within their premises.



## Construction and Functionality of DSS/RSS/EHVRS



The installations' height is determined by the necessary technical requirements for their effective functioning. These specifications do not consider the height parameter in the Floor Space Index (FSI). Exceptionally, DSS/RSS/EHVRS may be constructed beneath public open spaces (POS), provided that the occupied area does not surpass 20% of the developed area of such POS. With the Commissioner's consent, these limits may be exceeded in rare cases. Specific permission from the Municipal Corporation has to be availed to construct underground DSS/RSS/EHVRS.



## Additional Terms and Conditions 



The construction of these stations, subject to applicable terms, conditions, and payment, should comply with the safety precautions emphasized by the Electricity Distribution Company and the Chief Fire Officer's demands. Lastly, the Electric Distribution Company is responsible for developing and maintaining these stations at their own cost, with a minimum area kept for public use except for the space required for ingress and egress as per Regulation 53. The land for DSS/RSS/EHVRS can either be provided by the electric supply company or obtained following the government's policy by the respective electric supply company.


# Comprehensive Guide to Additional Facilities in a Large-Scale Development or Layout



## Specifications for Shopping Centers and Departmental Stores in Subdivisions above 2 ha



Shopping centers or departmental stores may be accommodated in subdivisions or amalgamations of areas exceeding 2 ha in both residential and commercial zones. The total Built-Up Area (BUA) of such establishments can be up to 5% of the Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) of the plot they occupy.



The structuring of these centers or stores may be at one place or distributed within the layout to ensure all sections of the layout are accessible. Nevertheless, these establishments should not be bordered by any roads wider than 31 meters. 



Interestingly, shopping centers may be confined within building towers without any accessibility or frontage on any public road. Another noteworthy feature is that these centers or stores can occupy the ground and upper floors or be situated on the ground floor while the upper floors serve residential purposes and conveniences like banks or places for medical or dental practitioners.



## Additional Permissible Uses in Residential Buildings



As per Clause (31) of Regulation No. 2, the uses of these centers or stores must meet certain criteria. It is worth noting that establishing a restaurant or eating house in a residential building is not permissible. Additional acceptable uses include the following entities:



- Retail stores or shops, which can store or sell combustible materials only with the Commissioner's permission. 


- Service establishments providing personal services. 


- Frozen food stores. 


- Clothes cleaning and pressing establishments without exceeding specific floor area, employment and power requirements. 


- Shops for goldsmiths, locksmiths, opticians, and others, provided they do not employ more than 9 individuals. 


- Coffee selling and grinding establishments that restrict their electric motive power.

1. In Island City, for Residential/Commercial zones with a road width of less than 9m, the basic Zonal FSI is 1.33, with no additional FSI on payment of premium or Admissible TDR FSI. Therefore, the Total Permissible FSI is 1.33



2. If the road width in Island City's Residential/Commercial zone is 9m or more but less than 12m, the basic Zonal FSI is 1.33, Additional FSI on payment of premium is 0.5, and Admissible TDR FSI is 0.17, totaling to a Permissible FSI of 2



3. For roads 12m and above but less than 18m, in Island City's Residential/Commercial area, the basic Zonal FSI remains 1.33, Additional FSI on payment of premium increases to 0.62, and Admissible TDR FSI escalates to 0.45, yielding a Total Permissible FSI of 2.4



4. For road measures 18m and above but less than 27m in Island City in Residential/Commercial zones, the Total Permissible FSI sums to 2.7, composed with a basic Zonal FSI of 1.33, Additional FSI on payment of premium of 0.73, and an Admissible TDR FSI of 0.64



5. For Residential/Commercial zones in Island City with roads 27m and above, the Total Permissible FSI is 3, contributed by a Basic Zonal FSI of 1.33, Additional FSI on payment of premium 0.84, and Admissible TDR FSI of 0.83



6. Suburbs and extended Suburbs including The area earmarked for BARC from M ward allows a basic Zonal FSI of 0.75 for Residential/Commercial zones, with no other additions, making the Total Permissible FSI 0.75



7. In areas of the village of Akse, Marve, and CRZ affected areas of Erangal in P/North Ward (excluding gaothan proper) within Suburbs and extended Suburbs, the Total Permissible FSI for Residential/Commercial zones is 0.5, accrued solely from a basic Zonal FSI of 0.5


8. In the remaining areas of suburbs and extended suburbs, for Residential/Commercial zones with a road width of less than 9m, the basic Zonal FSI is 1, with no additional FSI on payment of premium or Admissible TDR FSI. Therefore, the Total Permissible FSI is 1

9. If the road width in the remaining areas of suburbs and extended suburbs's Residential/Commercial zone is 9m or more but less than 12m, the basic Zonal FSI is 1, Additional FSI on payment of premium is 0.5, and Admissible TDR FSI is 0.5, totaling to a Permissible FSI of 2


10. For roads 12m and above but less than 18m, in the remaining areas of suburbs and extended suburbs's Residential/Commercial area, the basic Zonal FSI remains 1, Additional FSI on payment of premium increases to 0.5, and Admissible TDR FSI escalates to 0.7, yielding a Total Permissible FSI of 2.2

11. For road measures 18m and above but less than 27m in the remaining areas of suburbs and extended suburbs in Residential/Commercial zones, the Total Permissible FSI sums to 2.4, composed with a basic Zonal FSI of 1, Additional FSI on payment of premium of 0.5, and an Admissible TDR FSI of 0.9

# Detailed Analysis of Floor Space Indices (FSI), Built-Up Area (BUA) Computation, Tenement Density, and Protected Development Considerations



It's important to note that any plots bordering public roads with an existing width of at least 6m but less than 9m, which are expected to be increased to 9.0 m or more, will have a permissible FSI equivalent to those for 9m road width. Furthermore, the government can alter the TDR & additional FSI on premium Ratio while the total Cap remains unchanged.



Another vital point is that the permissible FSI will be calculated based on plot area but it won't include areas under DP roads/roads, stipulated Regular lines per MMC Act, regulation 16, 14 (amenity plots), and sections of DP Reservation to be delegated to MCGM/Appropriate Authority under Regulation 17.



In the context of Sr. No. 2, mobile terminated rates (MTR) per regulation 32 Table 12(A) of the land surrender to MCGM/Appropriate Authority outlined in Sr.No.2 might be permissible to be transformed into FSI under column No.6 of Table no. 12 on the remaining/balance plot within the acceptable limit of MTR except in the case of development of reserved area applying the Accommodation Reservation (AR) principle under regulation 17. While developing reserved regions under AR, the Note 20(vii) & (viii) of regulation 17(1) should be activated.



Additionally, FSI equivalent to TDR as per Table 12 A of Regulation 32, in lieu of road widening or roads planned under the D.P. or the MMC Act, 1888 per Regulation 16 may be permissible to be used in addition to the permissible FSI defined in column 7 of table 12, on the residual plot. The condition is that the total FSI doesn't surpass 1.25 times the permissible FSI as given in column 7 of table 12.



It's also permitted that TDR in lieu of the cost of construction of built-up amity to be transferred as per the provisions of Regulation number 17(1) note 1(d) may be allowed within permissible BUA. If not consumed on the remaining land elsewhere, the owner is allowed to avail the TDR.



If an owner/developer is unable to utilize even the Zonal (basic) FSI due to planning constraints, they are eligible for TDR for the unused BUA thereof including a & c above. In such instances, no additional FSI on premium payment/TDR is allowed to be utilized on the residual/balance plot. This rule is currently kept in abeyance.



Finally, the permissible FSI would be calculated on plot area incorporating areas for surrender to MCGM/Appropriate Authority per Regulation no 35 (development of cotton textile mills). There is another law, currently in abeyance, that BUA so computed will be permissible to be consumed on the remaining plot following the handing over of Reservation/Amenity/Plot/DP road/roads for which sanctioned Regular line is prescribed as per MMC Act to MCGM within the allowable limit.





# Regulation 30-  Comprehending the Rules Around Floor Space Indices, Built-Up Area Calculation, Tenement Density, and Protected Development 



A premium will be levied for 'additional Floor Space Index (FSI), demanding a fee' as enumerated in column no 5 of table no 12(Addiotional FSI on payment of premium/Premium FSI). These charges are for Built-Up Area (BUA) at the rate of 50% of the land rates/Read Reckoner rate, as per the Annual Statement Rate (ASR) specifically for FSI 1 in the relevant year. Alternatively, the fees may be as dictated by the government periodically. 



This premium charged is distributed equally at 25% among four entities, namely the State Government, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC), and the Dharavi Authority. MCGM utilizes its share of the premium for implementing Development Plan (D P).



There is an additional clause specifying that the utilization of the 'additional FSI demanding a fee' and Transferable Development Rights (TDR) is optional. Their use can be sequenced as required, limited by the specifications in column no 5 & 6 of Table No 12. Furthermore, the 'extra FSI demanding a fee' cannot be transferred. They are granted upon application and payment of the premium, and must be used on the same plot.



The regulations impose a Development cess calculated at 100% of Development charge. This cess applies to BUA exceeding the Zonal (basic) FSI or Protected BUA, considering whichever of the two is higher. This computation excludes the fungible compensatory area. The payment schedule of this Development cess is decided by the Commissioner of MCGM.



However, certain scenarios exist where this Development cess is not applicable. These include instances where the BUA is transferred to MCGM or another appropriate authority, or the BUA is excluded from the FSI calculation. Additionally, the Development cess is not levied on Government or MCGM endeavours carried out departmentally.



Conversely, this Development cess or off-site infrastructure charges are applicable according to Regulation nos 33(3), 33(3)(A), 33(3)(B), 33(5), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(9), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(11). These charges are applied as described in the applicable regulations.



Lastly, property owners are mandated to turn over the land to MCGM, MHADA, or any relevant authority when they seek permission for property development. The burden of resolving all encumbrances and completing the transaction in the name of MCGM, MHADA, or the deemed authority in the Land Revenue Record, rests on the property owner.


# Detailed Discussion on The Floor Space Indices, Built-Up Area Computation, Tenement Density, and Protected Development



The mentioned plot, which is devoid of any claims or disputes, is set to be transferred to the MCGM/MHADA or the concerned Authority within 24 months, from the approval date of the building plans or the layout. The Floor Space Index (FSI) of this particular plot can be employed on the rest of the area only after it is handed over to MCGM or prior to applying Zonal (basic) FSI beyond 75% of the total plot area or prior to providing an Occupation Certificate to any situated buildings, whichever occurs first. Transferring the ownership of this plot to the MCGM/MHADA or the appropriate authority in Land Revenue Records is a prerequisite before occupying any of the structures other than the amenity within the layout.



In the initial phase, the built-up amenity area is included in FSI. After the handover of said built-up amenity, it will be FSI exempted. The commencement certificate related to the Built-Up Area (BUA) as a counterpart for the built-up amenity that will be handed over to MCGM, can only be issued after the handover of the mentioned built-up amenity.



Provisions under Regulation no 31(3) and Table No.12 permit Fungible compensatory area, fungible area, or BUA over the permissible FSI. Combining various regulations to develop plots is allowed while keeping the maximum permissible FSI within the limits prescribed by the respective regulations. 



It is, however, not permissible to use a Transferable Development Right (TDR) in lieu of the balance BUA following the loading of the additional FSI with a premium and Admissible TDR according to the table 12. If development rules such as 33(2), 33(3), 33(3) (A), 33(3) (B), 33(8) (B), 33(11), 33(20)(A), are followed for development, the premium will be applicable to the Central Government, their statutory bodies, Central Government undertaking/State Government undertaking and more except the State Government and MCGM themselves.



In circumstances where the owner/developer refrains from utilizing the extra FSI approved under provisions of previously sanctioned Development Control and Promotion Regulations, 2034 and 1991 Development Control Regulations, and if the commencement certificate for such extra FSI hasn't been issued, the premium paid to the Government for the additional FSI would be refundable after deducting administrative charges of 10%, without interest.



Also, the terms and conditions stated in the directive issued on 14 March 2016 on premium levy under section 154 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, will be applied, subject to amendments. It's important to note that when computing BUA/FSI, the open space area of the layout required under Regulation No 27 will not be subtracted.



For new Development/Redevelopment proposal under this regulation, if the plot is affected by a Road line or a Development Plan (DP) discrepancy, then it would require additional considerations.


# Detailed Overview of Floor Space Indices & Floor Space / Built-Up Area (BUA) Computation, Tenement Density and Protected Development


In cases where lands have been affected by road lines, Development Plan (DP) roads, or reservations, and either incorporated or transferred to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or another appropriate authority, attention must be paid to the plot area measurements. If Floor Space Index (FSI) advantages from such lands have already been applied in prior development proposals in accordance with prevailing regulations, or if monetary compensation for these lands has previously been claimed but ownership has yet to be officially transferred over to the MCGM or an appropriate authority, the noted plot area should be determined after deducting these areas.



The Occupation Certificate for buildings constructed using the final 25% of lawful FSI for residential or commercial utilization will only be issued by the Commissioner following the successful development and on-site provision of a recreational region. However, in scenarios where a layout incorporates two or more buildings, the creation of a proportionate recreational sector may be permitted, on condition that the entirety of the recreational region and any structures thereon dedicated to recreational activities have been finalized prior to requesting occupation of the last building(s).



When it comes to government, semi-government entities, public sector authorities, and undertakings such as the Atomic Energy Department, the Civil Aviation Department, the International Airport Authority of India, defence authorities, railway authorities, and the Mumbai Port Trust, particular aspects will be disregarded when calculating the available FSI. These exemptions include areas not used as amenities or reservations but represented as such on the DP, namely playgrounds, stadia, golf courses, parade grounds, training grounds, firing ranges, green spaces within respective complexes, lands reserved for operational purposes, lands under major internal roads, railway tracks and yards, lands wrongfully reclaimed, and lands utilized for airfields and airstrips.


# In-depth Review on Floor Space Indices, Floor Space/Built-Up Area (BUA) Computation, Tenement Density and Protected Development


## Emphasis on Tenement Density



The stipulated maximum tenement density is specified as 450 per hectare for a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 1.00. It is critically noted that this measure can be appropriately increased or reduced, proportionately linked to the FSI 1.00.



In a similar vein, the minimum tenement density for programs involving Rehabilitation and Resettlement or affordable housing plots is stated as 325 per hectare for an FSI value of 1.00. It should be comprehended that this benchmark is subject to appropriate increase or decrease, proportionately tuned to the relative FSI 1.00.


# Detailed Discussion on Floor Space Indices (FSI), Built-Up Area (BUA) Computation, Tenement Density, and Protected Development Policy



##  Guidelines on Protected Development



The Floor Space Index (FSI) permissions, as outlined in Table No. 12, permit for a possible surpassing during the redevelopment of a pre-existing, approved building. This excess is bounded by the magnitude of the previously approved development rights or Built-Up Area (BUA). Additionally, an entitlement to the extra FSI will be accorded according to applicable regulations.



To expound further, if an entity had previously utilized the advantage of additional FSI under prevailing regulations for educational establishments, medical facilities, starred hotels category, religious development, or Information Technology infrastructures, and decides to propose redevelopment discontinuing such uses, then the extra BUA thus availed will not qualify for protection. Any development pursued needs to harmonize with these regulations' provisions with no adjustments for the premiums previously paid for such uses.



In instances where development is incomplete, the regulatory guidelines allow to claim the residual development rights under the same regulations through the Transferable Development Rights (TDR) or additional FSI by paying a Premium. These payment adjustments cover any past made payments for availing the FSI, granting any concessions, abeyances, etc., but no refunds are permissible here.



An important condition states that if the proposed development is confined to the protected built-up area as per clause (a) above, a 9-meter road width is considered sufficient. However, a development proposed beyond the protected area will be subject to restrictions, as mentioned in regulation 19(2).

# Fungible Compensatory Area Regulations in Development Control


## Provisions and Premium Charges for Fungible Area in Residential, Industrial, and Commercial Development



### Permissions for Fungible Compensatory Area


Despite provisions in D.C.Regulations 30, 32, & 33, the Commissioner may permit a fungible compensatory area, up to 35% beyond permissible FSI/BUA, for residential, industrial, and commercial development. This is allowed by levying a premium of 50% for Residential, and 60% for Industrial and Commercial development based on ASR (for FSI 1). The premium is divided among MCGM (50%), State Government (30%), and MSRDC for Sea Link (20%).



### Fungible Area in Affordable Housing and Redevelopment


In redevelopment cases under regulations 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(8), 33(9), 33(9)(B), 33(20), and 33(10), excluding clause No.3.11, the fungible compensatory area for Affordable Housing (AH) and R&R component is granted without a premium. Similarly, under regulations 33(5), 33(6) & 33(7)(B), the fungible compensatory FSI area on existing BUA is provided without a premium charge.



### Special Provisions for EWS/LIG Category and Rehab Entitlement


Redevelopment schemes of EWS/LIG category under Regulation 33(5) grant fungible compensatory area on rehab entitlement not exceeding 35 sq.mt without charging a premium. Additionally, redevelopment proposals of existing buildings using TDR/Additional FSI, grant fungible compensatory area on FSI consumed without premium, given the existing use continues.



### Restrictions on Fungible Compensatory Area Usage


The fungible compensatory area for rehabilitation components cannot be used for free sale components and may be used to provide additional area to existing tenants/occupants. The compensatory area for one rehabilitation tenement cannot be utilized for another.



### Premium Exemptions for Specific Developments


In developments under Regulation 33(15) and 33(2), excluding private medical institutions under 33(2)(A), fungible compensatory areas are admissible without a premium charge. For Regulation 33(2), a 50% rebate in premium is applicable.



### Explanatory Note


The regulation applies where IOD/IOA is granted but the building is incomplete, at the owner/developer's discretion. For plots/layouts with IOD for partial development, this regulation applies to the balance potential of the plot. The fungible compensatory area can be used as regular FSI.





# Detailed Information on Fungible Compensatory Area and Fungible Area (Regulation 31(3))



## No Adjustment of Premium Paid for Previous Fungible Compensatory Areas in Commercial/Industrial Development



It should be noted that any premium paid previously for fungible compensatory area, prior to the enactment of this regulation, especially in terms of commercial or industrial development, will not be adjusted. This means, for additional fungible compensatory area granted under this regulation, the premium fee, if any, as per this regulation will still be required. 



## Continuation of Fungible Compensatory Area from DCR 1991 to DCPR 2034 under Regulation 31(3)



The fungible compensatory area that was granted under Regulation 35(4) of the Development Control Regulations (DCR) 1991 will continue to exist as fungible compensatory area or fungible area under Regulation 31(3) of the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) 2034. No premium charges shall be demanded, refunded, or adjusted for this area. 



## Separate Account for Premium Amount Collected for Infrastructure Development



For proper management, the premium amount collected from this arrangement will be maintained in a separate account. This fund is exclusively dedicated to enhancing and supporting infrastructure development. 



## Condonation of Deficiency in Open Space Resulting from Use of Fungible Compensatory Area



There is a condition to excuse the deficiency in open space caused by the use of fungible compensatory area. This will be facilitated by charging a premium fee at 25% of the normal premium rate for the under-supplied open space.


# Regulation 32- Detailed Overview on Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)


## 32(1)- Explanation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR)



Transferable Development Rights, also known as TDR, is a kind of compensation given in the structure of Floor Space Index (FSI) or Development Rights itself. This method of compensation empowers the proprietor for the construction of the built-up area, adhering to the regulations set in the Development Right Certificate (DRC). Crucially, the FSI credit that is issued will be contained in a document known as the Development Right Certificate (DRC).



### The Issuance and Endorsement of Development Rights Certificate (DRC)



The task of issuing the Development Rights Certificate (DRC) falls under the purview of the Municipal Commissioner, who will sign and endorse the document. The document will unequivocally include, in both figures and words, the amount of FSI credit, in square meters, of the built-up area that the property owner or the leaseholder is authorized. Additionly, the place of its genesis and the rate of that plot will be detailed as outlined in the Annual Statement of Rates. The Rates are syndicated by the Registration Department for the corresponding year.


## 32(2)-  Detailed Explanation of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and Cases Eligible for TDR under Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966



- The section 32 of the document primarily discusses the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in relation to the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.


- A key instance where TDR eligibility arises is when a land, proposed in Draft or Final Development Plan for public purposes like road-widening or new roads is subject to acquisition.


- TDR is also applicable to lands under any deemed reservations, according to any regulations prepared as per the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act, 1966.


- Lands proposed for new roads or road widening under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888 are also eligible for TDR.


- The scope of TDR extends to the development or construction of amenities on reserved land as well.


- Interestingly, unutilized FSI of any structure or precinct deemed as a Heritage structure or Precinct per these Regulations, due to imposed restrictions, is TDR-eligible.


- The provision of constructing housing for slum-dwellers according to regulations under the Maharashtra Regional & Town Planning Act, 1966, can result in the land owner being awarded TDR as well.


- Occasionally, the Government may notify any new or modified provision for TDR eligibility.


- A historically unreserved, accessible plot can affiliate itself with TDR regulations if the owner willingly offers the land for public purpose and the Municipal Commissioner, MCGM considers the land suitable for public use. 


- TDR extends to lands owned by the Central Government / State Government and their undertakings, given these lands are reserved for public purpose and have been procured at market prices. However, note that lands under reservations granted on lease at concessional rates by the Central Government and State Government are not eligible for TDR.


# Exclusion Criteria for Transferable Development Rights (TDR)



## 32(3)- Situations That Do Not Qualify for Transferable Development Rights (TDR)


The following circumstances are deemed ineligible by law for Transferable Development Rights (TDR), which provides a strategy to control land use, balance development, and preserve property rights:



1. Land acquisitions or development projects for which partial or full compensation has already been rendered in any form are not eligible for Transferable Development Rights (TDR).


2. Properties with a legally declared award under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894 or the Right to Fair Compensation & Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act of 2013 do not qualify for TDR, unless they are withdrawn by the appropriate authority as per the respective Acts.


3. Cases in which a layout has already been approved before the implementation of these Regulations, and where layout roads are incorporated as Development Plan roads, are not suitable for TDR.


4. Plotted layouts submitted with a proposed Development Plan Road do not qualify for TDR, specifically concerning the width of the road that is necessary according to its length under these Regulations.


5. Owners who have already received compensation in the form of Floor Space Index (FSI) or through any other means cannot be granted TDR.


6. Situations involving lawful possession of property, whether by mutual agreement or contract, are excluded from TDR.


7. Existing or retention users, as well as mandatory open spaces or layout open spaces in any layout needed or provided under these Regulations, are not eligible for TDR.


8. Any existing amenity or zone usage allocation that is not subject to acquisition is exempt from TDR.


9. The incentive TDR will not apply to what are legally deemed reservations.


10. Natural features, such as existing nallas, rivers, streams, ponds, tanks, and other water bodies, are not eligible for TDR.


#  Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Generation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) and Their Extent of Entitlement



##  32(4): Mechanism for the Generation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) In Case of Land Acquisition



Transferable Development Rights (TDR), or Development Rights (DR), are offered to the owners who surrender their gross area of land, which is subjected to acquisition. This surrender is required to be free of cost and relieve the owner of all encumbrances. The owner's entitlement for TDR or DR is irrespective of the Floor Space Index (FSI) permissible or the development potential of the particular land to be surrendered as well as the adjoining lands. This entitlement rate varies according to specific conditions.



##  Table No. 12-A: Elucidating the Extent of TDR or DR Entitlement for Land Surrendered/land lost in Various Instances



In the scenario where a plot of land has been reserved for public purposes according to the detailed provincial plan (DP), Revised layout(RL), Nala widening, or a clause as per Regulation 2(viii) and is transferred to the Mumbai City Government Municipal Corporation (MCGM) or an appropriate authority, the entitlement for TDR or DR is 2.5 times the area of the surrendered or lost land within the Mumbai City area. Similarly, within the Mumbai Suburban or Extended Suburban area, the entitlement is 2 times the area of the surrendered or lost land. However, these are only applicable when the FSI benefit is not approved in the development proposal on the rest of the plot and when no TDR or monetary compensation has been availed due to no fault of the landowner. Similarly, the owner is entitled if there is no award declared under the relevant Act or if no compensation has been paid.



For instances when there is a subsequent road widening, a proposed DP road occurs, or a setback due to scenarios when the development of a plot or layout is completed, or where no development is proposed or is in progress at the time of the land handover to the MCGM, the owner is entitled to Development Rights equivalent to the Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index of the transferred land. 



In cases of Regulation 33(7), 33(8), 33(9), 33(10), No.33(11), 33(20)(B), the entitlement to TDR or DR is in accordance with the provision prescribed under the relevant DCPR. 



For further information related to different instances and their corresponding extent of TDR or DR entitlements, refer to Table No. 12-A continued.


# Generation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in Construction Projects



## Heritage Buildings and Their Regulation within Transferable Development Rights (TDR) 



In Mumbai City, areas that are reserved for heritage buildings have an entitlement for TDR or Development Rights (DR) equal to 2.5 times the unconsumed plot area, as per the zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI). In the suburban or extended suburban areas of Mumbai, this entitlement is reduced to 2.0 times the unconsumed plot area, per the zonal (basic FSI). However, if the development of a building is not permissible due to Regulation No. 52, and the Municipal Commissioner gives permission - upon recommendation from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) - the potential of the plot will be permanently reduced and frozen to the extent of the existing Built Up Area (BUA) of the structure.



## Procedure Regarding Encumbered Plots Required for Urgent Public Projects 



There is a provision for encumbered plots, which are essential for immediate public project execution. When the land is fully encumbered and encumbrances need to be eliminated and relocated by the project implementing authority, the entitlement is 50% of the Built Up Area (BUA) according to the zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) of the plot area. In cases where the plot is partly encumbered, two factors are considered: land portion that was vacant or encumbered. Both offer entitlement equivalent to 50% of the BUA per the zonal (basic) FSI of the vacant plot area. Simultaneously, the project implementing authority should separate the vacant land and the encumbered land areas along with supporting details from a joint measurement survey with the City Survey Officer.



This entitlement applies to compensation offered as Floor Space Index (FSI) to the owner to be deployed on the unaffected section of the same land parcel. In such situations, the Development Right Certificate (DRC) procedure laid out by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) would not be required. However, if the prevailing Development Control and Promotion Regulations do not permit land leveling and the construction or erection of a compound wall or fencing (as per Clause 4.1.2), or the MCGM does not insist on these, the developer must pay construction or leveling expenses to the MCGM following their policy. Otherwise, the TDR quantity will be reduced to 1:2.35 and 1:1.85 in Mumbai City (Island City) and Mumbai Suburban/Extended Suburban area respectively.


#  Legal and Regulatory Framework of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in Urban Planning


##  Generation and Implementation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR)



1. To facilitate urban development and land acquisition, landowners proposing to surrender their land for Transferable Development Rights (TDR) may receive an additional incentive Transferable Development Rights (TDR). This incentive can be up to 10% if the land is surrendered to MCGM within 24 months and goes down to 5% if surrendered within 36 months from the date these regulations become effective. The owners have the right to use these entitlements as Floor Space Index (FSI) on the remaining plot or within the same layout as allowed by these regulations.



2. The quantum of TDR generated for developmental activities in certain areas including, but not limited to, D.P. Road/ reservation, Coastal Regulation Zones(CRZ), Hilltop-Hillside (HTHS), Low Density Zone, Hazardous Zone, Special Development Zone, or in areas with any natural or legal impediments to construction or development shall be set at 50% of the typical TDR generated. This specification applies only if the Municipal Commissioner confirms that the pertinent land can serve its intended purpose.



3. With respect to government-owned land that is fully encumbered, the TDR provisions will follow the Government's guidelines and clarifications.



##  Conditions for Issuing Development Right Certificate (DRC)



4. The issuing of a Development Right Certificate (DRC) only takes place following the land transfer to the Municipal Corporation. This transfer should come with compliance to conditions stipulated in these urban development regulations which include: (a) the free-of-cost and encumbrance-free handover and acceptance of the designated land for which TDR is sought; (b) leveling the surrendered land to match the surrounding ground level; (c) erecting a compound wall or fence at the owner's expense in compliance with regulations and to the satisfaction of the Municipal Commissioner.



5. However, there are situations where construction or fencing is either restricted or prohibited by regulations, or when it’s not mandated by the MCGM. In these cases, the developer would be required to pay the cost of construction/leveling to the MCGM as per policy, or the Quantum of TDR will be reduced. 



6. In specific areas scheduled for development, namely roads or areas set back for road expansion, the construction of compound walls or additional fencing is not necessary. For these areas, TDR equivalent to entitlement, as mentioned in regulation no 4.1.1, will be granted without any reduction.


# 
 Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and their Generation



## Explanation and Provisions of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) Generation



In case there exists any contiguous piece of land owned by the same owner or developer, over and above the land that is being surrendered for being accorded with Transferable Development Rights (TDR), and if this additional land remains unbuildable, then the Municipal Commissioner possesses the authority to grant Transferable Development Rights (TDR) for this remaining unbuildable land as well. This provision, however, stands valid only if the owner or developer transfers the ownership of this land to the municipal authorities free of any cost, encumbrance, or encroachment. 



Should such remainder land be a part of the proposed roads, it can be utilized for road-side parking, garden, open space or other road-side amenities inclusive of bus bays and public toilets among others. These uses, however, are contingent upon the decision of the Commissioner. If the remainder land in the context forms a part of the proposed reservation, the same would be accounted for within the said proposed reservation and developed correspondingly. 



It is the responsibility of the Municipal Commissioner to submit a quarterly report of such cases to the Government.


#   Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Concept and Methodology



##  Generation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR)



In the context of real estate regulation, when a property owner or lessee, with prevision approval from the Municipal Commissioner, willingly undertakes the development or construction of an amenity on the plot planned for surrender, this action is subject to specific requirements. The construction, completed at said owner or lessee's expense, must meet the satisfaction of the Municipal Commissioner.



Upon successful completion and handover of the developed or constructed amenity, along with the associated plot free of cost to the Municipal Commissioner, they may be granted additional land Transferable Development Rights (TDR). This specific increment pertains to the construction of such amenity, which can be quantified using the following formula:



**The Construction Amenity TDR (in sq.m.) = (A/B)*1.50*BUA**



In this context, 



- 'A' signifies the construction cost of the amenity, denominated in rupees, as per the construction rates mentioned in the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR), compiled by the Inspector General of Registration in the year the amenity's construction commenced.


- 'B' represents the land rate per square meter, following the rates in the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR), also prepared by the Inspector General of Registration for the respective year.


- 'BUA' refers to the Built-Up Area of the constructed or developed amenity.



Notably, a special provision is acknowledged for cases under the Slum Redevelopment Scheme. Pursuant to clause 3.11 of Regulation 33(10), the Construction Amenity TDR sees a considerable increase - by 1.35 times the TDR volume generated according to the formula mentioned above.


#  Understanding Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Utilization and Generation



## Subheading 32(4): Rules for Generation of Transferable Development Rights (TDR)



**Paragraph 1 - Use of FSI Credit for Transferable Development Rights (TDR) Utilization:** A Development Right Certificate (DRC) holder who desires to utilize FSI credit on a specific plot of land must attach the necessary DRCs to their development application. The proposal for Transferable Development Rights (TDR) utilization must include the prescribed documents as dictated by either the Commissioner or Government periodically.



**Paragraph 2 - Requirements for Development Permission Application Involving DRC Utilization:** When an application for development permission incorporates the use of a Development Right Certificate (DRC), the owner must submit the DRC to the Municipal Commissioner. The Commissioner will then provide a written endorsement, stating both numerically and verbally the TDR quantum proposed for utilization before granting development permission.



**Paragraph 3 - Use Rules for TDR Generated from All Land Use Zones:** Transferable Development Rights (TDR) generated from any land use zone can be utilized on any receiving plot, regardless of the land use zone, anywhere in Mumbai City (island city) and the Mumbai Suburban/Extended Suburban area. The equivalent Transferable Development Rights (TDR) allowed on receiving plot will follow this formula: X = (Rg / Rr) x Y. Here `X` indicates Permissible Utilisation of TDR/DR in sqm on receiving plot; `Rg` is the rate for land in Rs. per sq.m. from the ASR of generating plots in generating year; `Rr` is the rate for land in Rs. per sq.m. as per ASR of receiving plot in generating year; `Y` represents TDR debited from Development Right Certificate (DRC) in sq.m. It should be noted that all TDR, which includes slum and heritage TDR, should be utilized according to this regulation only.


#  Section 32: Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) Usage Regulations 



##  Article 32(5): Navigation and Limitations of TDR Application



The utilization of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) and its correlation to the road width will be overseen by Regulation 30(A), respecting specific caveats. The highest possible TDR allowed on any plot will be determined by Regulation 30(A) or specifications noted in these Regulations. The TDR stipulation does not include Floor Space Index (FSI) allocated towards inclusive housing. 



The maximum permitted TDR loading includes at minimum 20% Slum TDR and at a maximum of 50% from Column No.6 of Table No.12, Regulation 30 (A), or as mandated by the Government. Slum TDR and Development Right Certificates (DRC) can be used up to the permitted limit as insinuated above. 



In scenarios where a plot is situated on a dead-end access road, that is up to 50m from the main road and boasts a minimum width of 9m, it will be considered as front-facing the primary road for TDR utilization purposes. The same applies for plots with access to a 9m wide internal road. A Slum TDR usage relaxation premium, which is 10% of the regular premium, will be charged to sanction deficiencies in open spaces.



The restrictions on total maximum permissible built-up areas in terms of FSI concerning road width will not apply when the permitted FSI surpasses the basic FSI in various schemes. This includes projects like Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, redevelopment of cess and dangerous buildings, Urban Renewal Scheme, Redevelopment of Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA) buildings/Colonies, Metro Influence Zone, Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTs), Transit Oriented Development (TODs), etc., subject to specific provisions sanctioned by the Government. 



Extra FSI assigned to categories such as Educational building, Registered Charitable Institutional/ Medical /Hospital Building, Star Category Hotel, etc., can be availed either through full or part utilization of TDR or additional FSI, as per the owner's choice. Nevertheless, the road width restrictions as per these regulations will not apply when the owner opts for additional FSI utilization. In these cases, the maximum building potential limitation as stated in regulation No. 5.4.1 will not apply. 



The application of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) will be permissible by considering the Plot Area excluding the area affected by reservations or deemed reservation or plot area to be surrendered under the provisions of Accommodation Reservation and development plan road or prescribed R.L. to be handed over to Municipal Corporation Greater Mumbai (MCGM)/ Appropriate Authority.





#  Specifications on the Application of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in the Mumbai Metropolitan and Surrounding Zones



The use of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) shall be restricted in some areas. In the context of the Development Right Certificate (DRC), it cannot be applied to plots situated in the zones listed below:



1. The Development Right Certificate (DRC) shall not be accepted on receivable plots located in Special Development Zones. These include areas managed by the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority, Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority, Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation, Mumbai port trust, or any other Authorities appointed by the Government as a Special Planning Authority.


2. The allotment of plots for housing programs of slum dwellers having provision for addtional FSI under regulations 33(7), 33(9) & 33(10)  are exempt from the use of Development Right Certificate (DRC).


3. An exception exists where a non-slum or non-cessed plot is joined with a slum or cessed plot with the intent for better planning. In these cases, Development Right Certificate (DRC) remains applicable to the non-slum or non-cessed plot. The application of Development Right Certificate (DRC) in such scenarios will be managed as per the guidelines and requirements detailed in this Regulation and its sub clause (B).


4. The Development Right Certificate (DRC) cannot be implemented in zones where the bare minimum (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) is less than 1.0. 


5. Use of the Development Right Certificate (DRC) is not allowed within the Coastal regulation zone, except in specific cases where the use of TDR is accepted as per the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification 2011 and its subsequent amendments.


6. Areas subjected to developmental prohibition or limitations by any proclamation issued under the provisions of any Central or State Act (like CRZ regulations, Defense restriction zones, etc.), or under these regulations, are non-applicable for the use of the Development Right Certificate (DRC).


# Detailed Overview of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and General Stipulations



## 32(6) General Stipulations for Transfer of Development Rights (TDR)



### 32(6)(6.1) Development Rights (DRs) Granting Conditions



Development rights (DRs) will only be granted to an owner or lessee for reserved lands which are retainable and have not been vested or transferred to the Government or Urban Local Bodies. However, this condition is not applicable to lands exempted under section 20 or 21 of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulations) Act, 1976. An official undertaking outlining this effect has to be procured before the granting of a development right. In the instance of schemes approved under section 20 or 21 of the aforementioned act, the extent and conditions of DRs will be contingent on the specifics detailed in the scheme under section 20 and any additional conditions the Government stipulates. For nonretainable lands, the extent and conditions surrounding the grant of Development Rights will be specifically dictated by the Government. This regulation is subject to any amendments that the Government may decree over time. 



It's important to note that in the case of lands holding tenures other than Class-I, like Inamlands, tribal lands etc., a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the competent authority is required. This document should specify the division of share between the Government and land holder and confirm the transfer of such land in the name of Planning or Appropriate Authority. This NOC has to be produced by the land holder when submitting an application for a Transfer of Development Rights (TDR).



### 32(6)(6.2) Issuance of Development Right Certificates (DRCs)



The Municipal Commissioner is designated to issue a Development Right Certificate (DRC). The DRC is a printed certificate on bond paper in a form deemed appropriate by the Commissioner. This certificate serves as a transferable and negotiable instrument only after the Municipal Commissioner authenticates it. As a part of this process, the Commissioner is obliged to maintain a register detailing all transactions, grants or utilizations of the Development Right Certificate (DRC) in a form he/she considers appropriate.



### 32(6)(6.3) Timeline for Issuing Development Right Certificates (DRCs)



The Commissioner is mandated to issue a Development Right Certificate (DRC) no later than 180 days from the date when the application was lodged or a response to any requisition made by the Commissioner is received, depending on which event occurs later.


# Detailed Guidelines for the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and Use of Development Right Certificate (DRC)



## Procedure for Transfer of Development Right Certificate (DRC)



The Commissioner is responsible for authorising the transfer of a Development Right Certificate (DRC) according to the methods specified.   


- If the DRC holder passes away, the certificate can only be transferred after presenting the necessary documents as identified by the Commissioner, once legal ownership and successors have been properly verified.


- A holder of a Development Right Certificate (DRC) expressing a desire to transfer it to someone else must present the original certificate to the Commissioner, along with an application containing relevant documents and a legally-signed agreement by both the Transferor and the Transferee. The new owner's name, that is, the transferee's name, needs to be endorsed on the certificate. Without the Commissioner's endorsement, the transfer remains invalid, and the certificate can only be used by the current holder or transferor.



## Restriction on Using a Development Right Certificate (DRC) During Transfer



The use of the TDR from the certificate is not permitted during the transfer process.



## Situations Where Commissioners can Restrict the Use of a Development Right Certificate (DRC)



The Commissioner can prohibit the holder of a Development Right Certificate (DRC) from using the certificate under the following circumstances:


- Under orders from a competent court.


- If the Commissioner suspects that the Development Right Certificate (DRC) was obtained through fraudulent means or misrepresentation.



## Terms for Using Development Right Certificate (DRC) on Different Plots/Lands



A Development Right Certificate (DRC) can be applied to one or more plots or lands, irrespective of their current development status. They can be vacant, fully or partly developed, and the certificate can be used for any construction, including adding more floors, or used in any other way aligned with these Regulations.



## Use of Development Right Certificate (DRC) on Land with a Developement Plan



A Development Right Certificate (DRC) can be utilized on lands designated for buildable developments, whether vacant or already been developed for the same purpose, under these Regulations.



## Use of Development Right Certificate (DRC) on Land After Surrendering



A Development Right Certificate (DRC) can be employed on lands which are owned post surrender of required land and construction to the Planning Authority. For determining the potential of receiving Transferable Development Rights (TDR), the total area reserved prior to surrender must be taken into account.



## Infrastructure Improvement Charges Payable for Using TDR



The utilizer is obligated to pay Infrastructure Improvement Charges to the Planning Authority, calculated at a rate of 5% of construction cost as per the prevailing Annual Statement of Rates for a proposed amount of TDR to be utilized.


# Detailed Examination of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Vedting of Land and Issuing of Development Right Certificate (DRC)



## The Commissioner's Role in Verifying Land Ownership 



Before issuing a Development Right Certificate (DRC), the Commissioner makes sure that applicant is the legitimate owner of the land proposed for surrender. It requires a revision of the Property Register Card (PRC) to confirm the Planning Authority as the new titleholder.



## Commissioner's Responsibilities and Restrictions in Case of Appropriate Authority Transfer



If the Appropriate Authority for reservation differs from the Planning Authority, the Commissioner can grant TDR and hold possession acting as a facilitator. However, such power is subject to the condition that the Municipal Commissioner passes the possession of such land to the specific Appropriate Authority, after receiving the land's value. This transaction is as per the Annual Statement of Rates effective during the possession hand-over under reservation. 



## Special Provisions for State Government Department Land Transfers



In the case of the Appropriate Authority being a State Government Department, the Municipal Commissioner is obligated to surrender the land without charging any fees.


# Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Effect and Applicability of Regulation 32(8)



The applicability of the provisions stated in Regulation 32 regarding the generation of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) is not valid when a Development Right Certificate (DRC) has been issued prior to the publishing of these regulations. Even so, DRCs issued under the DCR-1991 for slum redevelopment and heritage is permitted to be utilized per DCR 1991 conditions, without indexation, for a single year only.



Any remaining balance of DRCs, issued under the DCR-1991 for slum redevelopment and heritage, will be indexed for use. In instances where ownership details are documented and, or there's a specific proposal for utilization of such TDR pending within the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) before these regulations, such TDR shall be permitted entirely in accordance with the DCR 1991.



Despite any details contained within these regulations, it's at the owner/developer's discretion to proceed with TDR generation in ongoing schemes per their valid and in-progress Regulation 33(10) & 33(14) of DCR 1991 conditions. In such cases, TDR generation and utilisation will be allowed to follow the DCR 1991. However, utilising these TDRs as per the regulation shall be allowed within 1 year from the issuance date of the DRC without indexation. Any remaining balance after one year will be recalculated as per DCPR 2034 standards for generation and indexed for use.


#  Transfer of Development Rights (TDR): Additional Regulations and Provisions for Granting TDR to Developers, Co-operative Housing Societies, and NGOs under DCR 33(10) and DCR 33(11)



##  Eligibility for Award of TDR for FSI differences



The developer, housing society, or the NGO in possession of a land plot, on which a Slum Rehabilitation Project (SRP) is sanctioned under these regulations, can qualify for the award of TDR. This is valid particularly for any existing differences between the approved and the potential Floor Space Index (FSI) on that plot. 



##  Issuance of Development Right Certificate (DRC)



The Commissioner of MCGM himself, upon the advice of the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), shall issue the Development Right Certificate (DRC) for the TDR. The DRC will document the total Development Rights credit measured in Built-Up Area (BUA), reported both numerically and verbally. Additionally, it will record auxiliary details such as the originating locale (including village/TP Scheme/Division, CS No/CTS No/FP No) and the year of issue of the DRC. 



##  Specification of Built-Up Area for DRC



The Built-Up Area (BUA) appended to the Development Right Certificate (DRC) will be calculated based on the BUA of the sanctioned Slum Rehabilitation Projects. This includes the area permitted for conversion into TDR as ratified by the CEO of Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). 



## Rewarding Additional TDR for Buildable Amenity 



On completion of a buildable amenity on the sanctioned slum rehabilitation plot, provided it's surrendered without any costs to MCGM, the Commissioner holds the power to award additional TDR for the amenity's construction as per Sr. No 3 of the table. However, such awards are conditional and the DRC will be granted only if all conditions stated in these regulations are met satisfactorily. 



## Recording the Transactions of DRCs



In accordance with the given regulations, the Commissioner will maintain a systematic record of all transactions linked to the granting and utilization of Development Right Certificates. The register will cover all DRCs stemming from slum rehabilitation projects and will be prepared in a format deemed fitting by the Commissioner.


#  Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) - Additional Regulations for the Grant of TDR to Owners/Lessees of Heritage Buildings/Heritage Precincts



In alignment with Regulation No. 52, owners or lessees of any Heritage building who experience a reduction in Development Rights (DRs) owing to restrictions put in place by the Commissioner or Government under Regulations No 52, are deemed eligible for the award of Transfer of Development Rights (TDR). The award in the form of Floor Space Index (FSI) is stipulated on and subjected to the conditions mentioned in section 2.



This award of TDR entitles the heritage building's owner to an FSI symbolized by a Development Right Certificate (DRC). The owner may utilize this certificate personally or transfer it to another individual.



To generate TDR, it is required for the owner to execute an agreement with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). This agreement mandates that the heritage building will be maintained by the owner in accordance with the Commissioner's decision. The agreement also includes a penalty clause for breaches of its conditions, as determined by the Commissioner. 



The potential of the plot on which the building stands will be permanently decreased to the extent of the existing Built-Up Area (BUA) of the structure, as stipulated in the terms of the agreement.


# 33(1)- Enhanced Understanding of the Utilization of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories: An In-depth Look at Religious Buildings



The municipal commissioner has the authority to permit an additional 0.5 Floor Space Index (FSI) to buildings that belong to a Registered Public Trust. This extra FSI is over and above the Zonal (basic) FSI under certain terms and conditions.



## Conditions for Attaining Additional FSI for Religious Buildings



The conditions to attain this additional FSI include the following:



1. Prior to seeking permission, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) needs to be obtained from both the Police Authority and the Collector for the religious building. 



2. The use of the additional FSI is strictly for religious purposes only. Yet, without considering this extra FSI, the building can have ancillary residential or commercial uses up to 10% of the Zonal (basic) FSI.



3. The granting of additional FSI is attributed solely to already authorized religious users who can ensure the structural stability of the building.



The additional FSI granted comes with a condition of payment of premium. This premium is set at a rate of 25% of the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR) or READY RECKONER of the land (for FSI 1) for the Built Up Area (BUA). The premium payment must be shared equally between the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) & the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). Additionally, the plot area should not be less than 250 square meters.


# 33(2)- Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for 33(2) - Buildings of Medical and Educational Institutions and Other Institutional Buildings covered under Regulation (2) (IV) (17) (g)



Under the topic of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) which may be allowed to certain categories, special permissions are provided to institutional buildings covered under Regulation (2) (IV) (17) (g). 



In particular, the Municipal Commissioner may, through special permission, authorize an FSI of up to 5 for medical institutions and up to 4 for educational and other institutional buildings. These allowances include the Zonal (basic) FSI specified in Table No 12. These are applicable to independent buildings on plots dedicated for educational or medical institutions, government or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) institutional buildings, public authorities, registered public charitable trusts, cooperative medical institutions established for charitable purposes, and private medical institutions. These allowances are subject to terms, conditions, and a minimum width of 13.40m, excluding education institutions.



Whenever additional FSI is granted to these aforementioned institutions, with the exception of state government and MCGM institutional buildings, a corresponding premium for Built-up Area (BUA) is also entailed. This premium is payable in bands of 10%, 15%, 20% and 30% of the land rates as per Annual Schedule Rate/Ready Reckoner (for FSI 1) for educational institutions, medical institutions, private hospitals, and other institutional buildings, respectively. Anything beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI requires these payments. The government retains the right to revise this premium rate, and the premium sum is shared equally between the government and the MCGM. 



Regarding the additional FSI beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI, up to 50% may be claimed through Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) without needing to pay the premium, provided the utilization of such TDR is aligned with the ownership or development options. 



Further conditions and terms pertaining to other institutional buildings covered under Regulation (2)(IV)(17)(g) might be designated by the government or the Municipal Commissioner as circumstances dictate.


# Detailed Specifications for the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Institutional Buildings in Maharashtra



## Explanation on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Institutional Buildings


To categorize, Institutional Buildings which lie under the regulation (2) (IV) (17) (g), may be sanctioned an extra Built-up Area (BUA) beyond the standard Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI). However, this extended area is constrained to be used solely for authentic medical purposes.



## Provisions for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Below Poverty Line Patients


Institutional buildings benefiting from the additional FSI are required to allot about 20% of their total bed count to Economically Weaker Section (EWS) patients or those below the poverty line, and to provide them with free treatment. Further, a 10% treatment capacity of the Outpatient Department (OPD) should be available for these patient groups at rates equivalent to those in Government hospitals.



## Facility Setup for EWS and BPL Patients


The facilities for EWS and BPL patients, proportional to the specified percentages mentioned above, should ideally be located within a separate building or wing. In cases where this setup isn't feasible, these facilities should be situated on a separate floor within the main premises.



## Authority and Regulations Compliance 


The Director of Health Services, Government of Maharashtra (GoM), will serve as the competent authority for overseeing adherence to the clauses (a) & (b). The Director also acquires the authority to determine penalties for violations of these conditions.



## Record Maintenance and Submission


Medical Institutions are imposed upon to maintain thorough records of their free and concessional medical services. These records should be periodically updated and made readily accessible to the Director of Health Services upon request.



## Compliance Undertaking 


Before the utilization of 50% of the additional permitted FSI beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI, Medical Institutions are necessitated to submit a formal undertaking. The submission incident affirms the institution's commitment to complying with the outlined terms and conditions.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Institutional Buildings



The following section focuses on the guidelines and regulations concerning the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that might be allotted to certain categories of institutional buildings, as outlined under Regulation (2) (IV) (17) (g).



## Allowable Uses for Additional Built-Up Area (BUA)



In the context of Institutional Buildings, the additional Built-Up Area (BUA) beyond Zonal (basic) FSI can only be used for authentic educational purposes. It is worth noting that these organizations are required to allocate some rooms for governmental use as needed.



## Government Reservation in Seat Capacity



In addition, these institutions must reserve 10% of their total seat capacity for government nominees, who are recommended by the Department of Education or the Department of Higher and Technical Education in the Government of Maharashtra (GoM).



## The Observance Authority and Rules



The competent authority for ensuring adherence to these points, including the determination of penalties for breach of conditions, is the Director of School Education or Higher and Technical Education from the Government of Maharashtra (GoM).



## Record Maintenance for Educational Institutions



Educational Institutions are also required to maintain and periodically provide records of free or concessional education. These records have to be readily available to the aforementioned government authorities on request.



## Undertaking for Additional FSI Utilization



Lastly, prior to utilizing 50% of the additional permissible FSI beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI, the Educational Institution must submit an undertaking to comply with these outlined terms and conditions.


# Provisions for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Certain Categories in Maharashtra State



The government may permit additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for certain categories, excluding the Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) component. The permission for this additional FSI will be subject to a premium payment that the government determines periodically. The Maharashtra state government and Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) will equally split this payment. The conditions specified under subheadings (A) and (B) are mandatory for compliance. 



The Municipal Commissioner has the role of informing the appropriate implementing authority about the issuance of building permissions or occupation certificates. This communication ensures that the said authority complies with the conditions mentioned under sections (A), (B) & (C). 



Non-compliance with the usage regulations of additional FSI will invoke penalties. Suppose the additional FSI is exploited and later it's identified that the constructed space caters for non-medical, non-educational, or non-institutional commercial activities, which are not met as per these regulations. In that case, a penalty comes into effect. This penalty fee will be a shared responsibility between the MCGM and the Government, with an allocation proportion of 3 to 1. 



The determination of misuse is through physical site verification conducted by a team of MCGM officials who initially approved the building plans. An imposed daily penalty equates to 0.3% of the present ready reckoner value of the misused built-up area. This penalty is effective from the day unauthorized use commences until the day non-medical, educational, or institutional activities cease. 



After paying the penalty to the MCGM, the concerned medical, educational, or institutional entity responsible for the building plans is obligated to revert the premises usage to the original intended purpose. The corresponding Letter of Intent (LOI) or Registration validates this original purpose. Suppose the concerned medical, educational, or institutional body fails either to fully pay the penalty or restore the premises usage. In that case, the MCGM will enforce suitable action within the guidelines of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966.



The explained provisions for Additional FSI, and the potential penalties, are in addition to the penal provisions prescribed under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act of 1966.


# 33(3)- Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted for Specific Categories: Focus on Government and Semi-Government Buildings, Statutory Bodies, and Public Sectors Undertakings(PSU) 



The subject under consideration, as stated by regulation 33(3), pertains to the buildings that fall under the Government, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), Statutory Bodies, Semi Government and Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs). Under special permissions granted by the Commissioner, an enhanced Floor Space Index (FSI) of up to 5 can be authorized. It is important to note that this FSI includes the Zonal (basic) FSI listed in Table 12, and is purposed for office use and other linked functions, excluding residential use. The emphasis is on meeting unique demands seen by the Government, MCGM, related statutory bodies, Semi Government, and PSUs.



## Maximum Permissible FSI Based on Road Width for Government, MCGM, Statutory Bodies, Semi Government, and PSU Offices

-  For buildings located on roads that are 12m to 18m wide, an FSI of up to 3 is permissible.


-  For buildings located on roads that are 18m to 27m wide, an FSI of up to 4 is permissible.


-  For buildings located on roads wider than 27m, an FSI of up to 5 is permitted.



## 33(3)(A)- Additional Provisions for Public Sector Undertakings



It is further provided that in the case of Public Sector Undertakings, the premium for FSI exceeding the Zonal (basic) FSI is subject to change as decided by the Government periodically.



Additionally, premium is also applicable for the built-up area (BUA) in exchange for the expanded FSI. This is at the rate of 50% of Annual Statement Rate (ASR) / Ready Reckoner of developed land (for FSI 1) or as determined by the government time and again. The only exception to this applies to developments by the State Government and MCGM.


###  33. Provisions for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in Government, MCGM, Statutory Bodies, Semi Government and PSU Offices


#### Regulations and Guidelines for Constructions of Staff Quarters and Free Sale Components



1. The Commissioner possesses the authority to allow FSI, including Zonal (basic) FSI as outlined in Table No. 12, up to a value of 4 on the gross plot area. It is conditioned on the plot abutting a road with a minimum width of 12 m, and be dedicated to the construction of staff quarters, henceforth referred to as the staff quarters project. This regulation applies to the employees of Government/MCGM or their statutory bodies, collectively termed as User Authority.



2. The land specified for the staff quarters project must be owned by the User Authority. The Public Works Department of the Government of Maharashtra, MHADA, Maharashtra Police Housing Corporation, MCGM, or any other Agency elected by the Government may execute the project. This list of authorized entities includes any Special Purpose Vehicle where the Government or a fully owned Company of the Government holds a majority stake of at least 51% in equity share, hereby grouped as Implementing Public Authority.



3. A premium will be charged for Built Up Area (BUA) in place of additional FSI. The rate is set at 50% of ASR/READY RECKONER of developed land for FSI 1, or as determined by the Government from time to time, except when the development is conducted by the State Government & MCGM.



4. FSI as permitted under this Regulation is applicable to the construction of quarters or hostel buildings for MLA/MLC undertaken by the State Government.  



5. The total permissible FSI as per this Regulation should be used for constructing staff quarters for the User Authority, adhering to the following guidelines:



   - The area of staff quarters or free sale component for varied employee categories must comply with the standards set by the concerned User Authority.


 
6. The Commissioner may also allow a maximum of 1/3rd of the total permissible FSI under this Regulation to construct a free sale area, referred to as free sale component. The Implementing Public Authority can dispose of this area to recuperate the cost of project execution.



7. The free sale component, if constructed, is recommended to be in a separate block. Plot subdivision is permissible if it helps achieve an equitable distribution of FSI when creating a free sale component.



8. In the event of the User Authority demanding the construction of staff quarters equal to the total permissible FSI of 4.0, they are required to bear the full cost of construction payable to the Implementing Public Authority. This payment will serve as a substitute for the free sale component.



9. If flats are developed under the free sale component, they must be initially offered to the Central Government, its statutory bodies, or the Central/State PSUs for purchase as staff quarters. If the stated entities do not express interest in purchasing the flats with a predetermined timeline, the flats can then be sold in the open market.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for certain categories 


##  Application of FSI rules to Government, MCGM, Statutory Bodies, and PSU Offices 



- The Development cess for buildings of the Government, MCGM, Statutory Bodies, Semi Government and PSU Offices is set at 7% of the Land Rate as specified by the Annual Schedule of Rates or Ready Reckoner for Floor Space Index (FSI) 1. This is applicable for the Built Up Area (BUA) that extends beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI. Importantly, this area excludes any Fungible Area, Fungible Compensatory Area or Fungible Area(FCA).


- On top of the Development cess, development charges as per section 124 of the MR & TP Act 1966 will also be levied.


- No premium will be charged for any Fungible Area, Fungible Compensatory Area or Fungible Area(FCA) that is approved as per Development Control Regulation (DCR) 31(3) when constructing staff quarters for the MCGM & State Government.


- Additionally, no premium is applicable for the construction of staircases, lifts, and lift lobbies for staff quarters for the MCGM & State Government.


- Any deficiency in open space will be charged at a rate of 2.5% of the land rate as determined by the Annual Schedule of Rates or Ready Reckoner for Floor Space Index (FSI) 1.


- The provisions of Inclusive Housing (IH) will not apply to any development under this Regulation.


- For any staff quarters project under this regulation, a Development Agreement will need to be executed between the User Authority and Implementing Public Authority. This agreement will authorize the Implementing Authority to dispose of the flats constructed under the free sale component of the project, wherever applicable.


## 33(3)(B)- Additional Provisions for development and redevopment on private land



### Permission and Incentives for Construction of Staff Quarters for Government and Semi-Government Entities



The Commissioner holds the authority to allow the construction of staff quarters for the employees of the Government, MCGM, and their statutory bodies, collectively referred to as the User Authority, on private plots of land which should ideally have a minimum area of 2000 sq.m and adjoin a minimum width of a 12 m road. This reiteration not only makes for a standalone sentence but also provides an overview of the section's main theme (Permission for Construction of Staff Quarters for government bodies)



Under these circumstances, an incentive FSI may be granted in lieu of BUA of staff quarters built and provided free of charge to the User Authority. However, a premium is payable at the rate of 50% of ASR/READY RECKONER of developer land (for FSI 1) or as decided by the Government from time to time, excluding the buildings of the State Government and MCGM.



The User Authority defines the area of the staff quarter for different employee categories, which is restricted from exceeding the carpet area upper limit.



#### Insight into Incentive FSI and its Dependence on BUA of Staff Quarters



For the 33(3)(B) - Development/Redevelopment for construction of staff quarters of Government or its statutory bodies (including CISF) or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or its statutory bodies on private lands, the incentive FSI is granted against the FSI required for the construction of Staff Quarters. 



In Island City, the incentive given is 40% of the required BUA of staff Quarters, and in Suburbs & Extended Suburbs, the incentive is 80% of the required BUA of staff Quarters. 



#### Information Pertaining to FSI Usage and Maximum Permissible FSI 



For the same plot of the 33(3)(B) project, FSI including Zonal (basic)/permissible FSI should be used per the table below:



- For a plot area of 2000 sq. m or more but less than 4000 sq.m with a road width 12m to 18m, the maximum permissible FSI is 3.00.


- For a plot area of 4000 sq. m or more with a road width more than 18m, the maximum permissible FSI is 4.00.



### Provisions Regarding Premium, Open Space Deficiency Charge, IH Applicability, and Development Cess



No premium will be charged for features permitted as per regualtion 31(1) and 31(3) for the construction of staff quarters to be handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority.



Open space deficiency will be charged at 2.5% of the land rate of ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI1). 



Notably, IH provision shall not be applicable for development under this Regulation.



For the BUA beyond Zonal (basic) FSI (excluding Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area(FCA)), a development cess at 7% of the Land Rate as per ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1) of the approval year should be paid to MCGM. Additionally, the development cess charges are apart from development charges levied as per section 124 of MR & TP Act 1966.


## Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Policy for Certain Categories



### Granting Additional FSI for Buildings of Government/MCGM/Statutory Bodies, Semi Government and PSU Offices



An official grant for the development or redevelopment of a vacant plot that belongs to a private landholder with the express purpose of constructing staff quarters for use by an Authority can be given by the Municipal Commissioner. However, this approval is mandatory and must be procured prior to the development or redevelopment. The approval for location and the requirement of staff quarters is decided by a committee specifically formed for this purpose by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM). 



In the specific case of flats proposed for conservancy staff quarters being developed or redeveloped under this regulation, there is a provision that allows a certain percentage of the flats, as decided by Government of Maharashtra (GoM), to be made available for ownership under the Shram Saphalya scheme.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Parameters for Various Categories: A Focus on Residential Hotels on Independent Plots



## 33(4)- Parameters and Regulations for FSI in Residential Hotels on Independent Plots



According to the prevalent regulations, an additional Floor Space Index (FSI) could be granted to buildings of Residential Hotels on independent plots. This is contingent on the payment of a premium for Built-Up Area (BUA) at a percentage (30%) of the land rates, based on ASR/READY RECKONER for FSI 1 or as dictated by the Government periodically. The premium will be shared equally between the Government and MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai). Various further terms and conditions apply to enforce this regulation. 



## Maximum Permissible FSI for Residential Hotels on Independent Plots Based on Road Width and Plot Size



The table data below refers to the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) based on the road's width and plot size for any residential hotels on independent plots:



1. For plots with a road width between 12m to 18m, the maximum permissible FSI is up to 3.


2. For plots with a road width from 18m to 27m, the maximum permissible FSI is up to 4.


3. For plots with a road width exceeding 27m, the maximum permissible FSI extends up to 5.



This policy is applicable to the total plot area excluding some predefined areas which need to be handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority under various conditions.



##  FSI Conditions for Independent Residential Hotels



A room reservation quota has been imposed wherein 5% of the total rooms must be earmarked for government or MCGM usage for a total of 30 days spread across the year. This will be monitored by the MTDC (Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation) and Protocol Department, with no room charges applied.



A development cess amounting to 7% of the Land Rate per the ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1) of the year of approval has to be paid to MCGM. This applies for the BUA beyond Zonal (basic) FSI, barring Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area(FCA). This cess is in addition to any development charges levied per MR&TP Act 1966.



Commercial usage of the premises for banquet halls, conference halls, meeting rooms, etc. is permissible, only up to 20% of the Zonal (basic) FSI. Mega/Ultra Mega classified projects, as per Maharashtra Tourism Policy-2016, can access an additional 20% FSI for Tourism support activities.



All concessions offered to classified Star category Hotels will also extend to Tourism Units designated as Mega Projects, Ultra mega Projects, and Large tourism units. 



Exceptions are not provided for parking and other requirements as per these Regulations. However, condonation of up to 25% could be conceded in case of spaces on the side and rear margins, with special permission from the Commissioner.



Out of the additional FSI beyond Zonal (basic) FSI, 50% may be obtained by utilizing TDR (Transfer of Development Rights), with no payment of premium. Utilization of such TDR is permitted only after leveraging the remaining additional FSI.





## A Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Specific Categories



### Potential Extra FSI for Residential Hotels on Independent Plots 



In the event of a proposed mixed use, an exception to the traditional rule may apply if the said mixed use combines utility types other than the previously stated category 3, along with a hotel of a star category. This situation may arise subject to the prerequisite condition of fulfilling the road width required for such mixed use. Under these specific circumstances, no additional Floor Space Index (FSI) is available at a concessional rate. This policy is significant since it modifies the FSI rules for independent plots, which could be building residential hotels with mixed uses, setting them apart from other categories.



To ensure proper segregation of these mixed uses, the provision of separate entrances, parking arrangements, as well as lifts and lobbies is a necessary requirement. This specification underscores the need for a stress-free and convenient access system for each distinct use within the mixed-use project.


# 33(5)- Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Development and Redevelopment of Housing Schemes by Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)



- Under the subsection 33(5) of housing developments and redevelopments, any new housing scheme initiated by MHADA on its own lands and aimed at Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Low-Income Group (LIG), and Middle-Income Group (MIG) categories shall be subject to an FSI of 3.0 on the gross plot area. This plot calculation excludes the Fungible Area/ Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA).


  
- The plan mandates that at least 60% Built-Up-Area (BUA) of the developed scheme shall comprise tenements intended for EWS, LIG, and MIG categories, as defined by the Maharashtra Government's Housing Department periodically. 


  
- The rules also permit exceeding the specified Floor Space Indices (FSI) up to 4.00 in the event of any land parcels that exceed an area of 4000 square meters and are bordered by roads with a width of 18.00 meters or more, but only with prior government approval.



- Similar conditions and FSI numbers apply to redevelopment projects for existing MHADA housing schemes that cater to EWS or LIG households, as well as MIG and High-Income Group (HIG) houses - as long as the carpet area remains less than the maximum area set for MIG houses.



- The FSI may, in these instances as well, exceed beyond stipulated numbers up to 4.00, for plots sized at 4000 square meters and above, fronting roads that are 18.00 meters wide or more. Permission to exceed limits is strictly provisional and subject to prior government approval. 



- Rules regarding redevelopment of buildings present within existing MHADA housing projects, when undertaken by housing co-operative societies, building occupants or MHADA lessees, are outlined in the following section 2.1. The associated Rehabilitation Area Entitlement, Incentive FSI and sharing of balance FSI are also explained according to their distinct parameters.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Categories 


##  33(5)- Development and Redevelopment of Housing Schemes by Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)



In the context of redeveloping buildings under existing Housing Schemes of MHADA, the rehabilitation area assigned to an existing residential tenement is set to be equivalent to the collective sum of:



- A standard entitlement, which correlates with the existing tenement's carpet area plus an additional 35% of it, yet ensuring a minimum carpet area of 35 square meters.


- An extra entitlement, manipulated by the dimensions of the plot being redeveloped, complying with the norms outlined in the following Table-A.


**Table-A : The table shows additional carpet area which can be offered to existing tenement based on area of the plot for 33(5)- Development / Redevelopment of Housing Schemes of Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)**.

According to the policy laid out by MHADA, certain plot sizes falling under the redevelopment plan are eligible for an increment in the existing carpet area. Briefly, these plot sizes and the corresponding increases are as follows:


- For plots ranging from 4000 sq.m to 2 ha in size, an additional 15% of the existing Carpet Area is permissible under redevelopment.


- For plots between 2 ha up to 5 ha, the additional Carpet Area granted stands at 25% of the initial space.


- The scheme allows for a 35% increment in Carpet Area for plots expanding from 5 ha to 10 ha during redevelopment.


- Lastly, in the case of plots larger than 10 ha, a 45% increment on the existing Carpet Area is bestowed.


## Explanation of Terms and Conditions in MHADA's Redevelopment Scheme



The 'plot under redevelopment' is the tract of land distinctly marked for redevelopment within MHADA's jurisdiction. As per the governing rules, the specification of 'existing Carpet area' or 'carpet area' denotes the overall usable floor extent in a dwelling, excluding the area consumed by the walls or any region specifically excused from FSI computation, as per the prevailing Regulation. However, the balcony areas are incorporated within this calculation, provided they're counted free of FSI as per the same regulation.



## Additional Provisions for Commercial/Amenity Units



In the context of existing building redevelopment within MHADA's Housing Schemes, commercial or amenity units within Residential Housing Schemes are entitled to an area rehabilitation equal to the carpet area of the existing unit augmented by an additional 20%.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Specifications for Housing Development/Redevelopment by Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)


## 33(5) - Incentive FSI Admissibility and Basic Ratio Calculation



In the context of development or the redevelopment of housing schemes by the MHADA, the admissibility of Incentive FSI against the FSI required for rehabilitation will depend on the Basic Ratio. This ratio revolves around the Land Rate (LR), measured in Rs per square meter for the plot under redevelopment according to the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR/READY RECKONER), and the Rate of Construction (RC), also in Rs per square meter, that applies to the area per the ASR/READY RECKONER as of the date of approval for the plan.



The segment below outlines the specifics of the Basic Ratio and its impact on the Incentive FSI in the development/redevelopment conducted by MHADA.



## Incentive Ratios Based on Basic Ratio for MHADA Housing Development/Redevelopment Projects


### Table B Specifications



- MHADA Housing Project with a Basic Ratio above 6.00, rewards an Incentive of 40% of the Admissible Rehabilitation Area.


- For a Basic Ratio surpassing 4.00 and extending up to 6.00, MHADA extends an Incentive of 50% of the Admissible Rehabilitation Area.


- Where a Basic Ratio exceeds 2.00 and reaches up to 4.00, the Incentive stands at 60% of the Admissible Rehabilitation Area.


- Lastly, MHADA awards an Incentive of 70% of the Admissible Rehabilitation Area to a Housing Project with a Basic Ratio inclusive of and up to 2.00.



These incentives, however, will be contingent on the FSI's availability on the redevelopment plot and its distribution by MHADA.



In cases where different land rates apply to different parts of the redevelopment plot, a weighted average of all these rates shall determine the Average Land Rate and the Basic Ratio. The consideration of Land Rate (LR) and Rate of Construction (RC) for the Basic Ratio calculation pertains to the year the redevelopment project receives approval from the Competent Authority.


# Detailed Analysis of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Specific Categories in Housing Scheme Reconstruction of Maharashtra 



These guidelines pertain to the allowance of additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for the Development/Redevelopment of Housing Schemes managed by Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA). The unallocated FSI, after apportioning for the rehabilitation and incentive components as prescribed by parts (A) and (B) respectively, will be distributed between the Cooperative Housing Society and MHADA as Built-Up Area (BUA) (refer to Table C). It is specified that MHADA's share of this BUA will be given to them without any cost.



## Proportional Distribution of Remaining FSI between Cooperative Society and MHADA as per Land Rate/Rate of Construction (LR/RC) Ratio (Table C)



1. For LR/RC Ratio greater than 6.00, Cooperative Society will get 30% share, while MHADA receives 70% of the remaining FSI.


2. For LR/RC Ratio between 4.00 and 6.00, the share of Cooperative Society is 35%, whereas MHADA’s share is 65%.


3. For LR/RC Ratio between 2.00 and 4.00, the Cooperative Society and MHADA get 40% and 60% respectively.


4. For LR/RC Ratio upto 2.00, the Cooperative Society will receive 45% and MHADA will get 55% of the remaining FSI.



## Stipulations for Plots Upto 4000 sq.m under 33(5)-MHADA Housing Scheme Redevelopment (Table C1)



In cases of plots up to 4000 sq.m, MHADA may allow additional Built-Up Area (BUA) over and above the existing BUA up to 3.00 FSI without insisting on MHADA's share in BUA form. This is permissible by charging a premium at the percentage rate of ASR/READY RECKONER based on the LR/RC ratio.



1. For LR/RC Ratio from 0 to 2: EWS/LIG, MIG, and HIG categories bear 40%, 60%, and 80% of ASR/Ready Reckoner charges respectively.


2. For LR/RC Ratio from 2 to 4: The charges for EWS/LIG, MIG, and HIG are 45%, 65%, and 85% of ASR/Ready Reckoner respectively.


3. For LR/RC Ratio from 4 to 6: EWS/LIG, MIG, and HIG segments will have to pay 50%, 70%, and 90% of ASR/Ready Reckoner respectively.


4. For LR/RC Ratio above 6: The ASR/Ready Reckoner charges for EWS/LIG, MIG, and HIG entities are 55%, 75%, and 95% respectively.



Please note that these rules are enacted with the aim to increase affordability and accommodation for constituents looking to participate in the 33(5)- Development / Redevelopment of Housing Schemes conducted by MHADA.


# Detailed Information on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for the Development/Redevelopment of Housing Schemes under Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)



## Sharing of Floor Space Index (FSI) Under the Context of MHADA's Housing Schemes



For the 33(5)-Development/Redevelopment of Housing Schemes initiated by MHADA, there is a provision of FSI sharing if the society or developer chooses to use 1.00 FSI based on shared housing stock. It operates as follows:



- When the LR/RC ratio ranges from 0 to 3.99, the MHADA is entitled to 30% of the share while the society or developer receives the remaining 70% share. 


- For an LR/RC ratio of 4.00 or above, the respective shares are 35% for MHADA and 65% maintained for the society or developer.



## Option for Premium Charges for the Allotment of FSI



The society or developer can choose the premium option wherein they can opt for the premium charges for allotment of 1.00 FSI, which is recovered at a rate of 60% of the prevailing land rate as per the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR/READY RECKONER). 



It should be noted that if the society or developer chooses this option, MHADA's share, including Fungible FSI, would be transferred to MHADA free of cost by the society or developer. Additionally, MHADA reserves the right to approve the allocation of its shared tenements either within the same Municipal Ward or an adjoining one, provided the valuation is consistent with the market value (determined by the ASR/READY RECKONER of that year). 



## Rehabilitation Area Entitlement in MHADA's Housing Scheme's Redevelopment



In case MHADA, or in partnership with housing societies or building occupants or MHADA's lessees, undertakes the redevelopment of buildings under its existing Housing Schemes, the Rehabilitation Area Entitlement will be increased by 15% of the existing carpet area beyond the initially computed value under section 2.1 (A).



## Provisions Regarding Fungible Area (FCA) and Utilization of FSI



It's important to note that no premium will be charged on the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA) related to areas transferred to MHADA, and these areas are excluded from the Fungible compensatory BUA calculation if availed.



Entire layout area, inclusive of Development Plan roads and internal roads (barring land under public amenities reservation) is taken into consideration for the FSI calculation. Plots sub-division is permissible based on the open spaces required as per these regulations. 



In the MHADA layout, the reservations can be developed as per Regulation No. 17(3). No restrictions exist on utilizing the permissible FSI under this regulation, except those imposed by law, rule, or regulation.



It's crucial to know that the carpet areas calculation for EWS, LIG, or MIG tenements is subject to periodic revisions made by the Government.


# Enhanced Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Different Categories: Focus on Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA) Redevelopment Schemes



## MHADA Housing Scheme Development: Infrastructure and Development Cess Regulations


1. Certain infrastructure provisions in view of increased population come associated with a Development Cess. For additional Floor Space Index (FSI) granted beyond normal FSI in redevelopment projects, a Development Cess, accounting for 7% of the Land Rate as indicated in the ASR/READY RECKONER of the approval year, will be implemented.


2. This excludes the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA).


3. MHADA will transfer 5/7th of the collected Development Cess to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai for offsite infrastructure development.


4. The levied Development Cess will be supplemental to the development charges imposed under section 124 of the MR & TP Act 1966.



## FSI and Premium Regulations in MHADA Housing and Redevelopment Projects


5. There will be no premium charges under Regulation No 31(1) and 31(3) for the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) considering the following scenarios:


   - If MHADA constructs EWS/LIG and MIG tenements on a MHADA plot.


   - In a redevelopment project where EWS/LIG and MIG tenements are built as part of MHADA's share.


   - Relaxations under Regulation No. 33(10) apply, excluding clauses 6.11, 6.15, 6.16, and 6.18.


6. For housing schemes under these regulations, a premium rate of 25% of the normal premium or 6.25% of the land rate as per ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1) - whichever is greater - will apply in case of EWS/LIG/MIG category tenement construction.


7. In such instances, the front open space must be at least 3.0 m.



## Conditions for Redevelopment Scheme Participation and Co-operation


8. In any redevelopment scenario where a Registered Cooperative Housing Society/Developer gets a NOC from MHADA/Mumbai Board for additional balance FSI acquisition with 51% member consent and ensures permanent alternate accommodation, it is required for all members to participate and vacate existing tenements for redevelopment.


9. If tenants fail to vacate, section 95A of the MHAD Act will be invoked for eviction.


10. For any existing MHADA Housing Scheme's redevelopment under clause 2.2 by MHADA itself, a valid Resolution consent from the Cooperative Housing Society as per the Co-operative Societies Act, 1960, is sufficient.


11. If any member does not co-operate with the approved redevelopment project, MHADA can take action under section 95(A) of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Act, 1976.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Categories


##  Development/Redevelopment of Housing Schemes by Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA)



The development or redevelopment of housing schemes under Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA) demands the establishment of a corpus fund by the developer. The selected amount, decided by MHADA, must be kept with the Co-operative Housing Societies. This fund is particularly for the maintenance of new buildings under the Rehabilitation Component.



An added provision allows for the possibility of convenience shopping along layout roads that have widths ranging from 9 meters to 18 meters. 



As part of the MHADA layout, if the land set for development is found to be partially occupied by a slum as per section 4 of the Slum Act (prior to 1.1.2000 or any other date notified by the Government), an integrated development approach can be adopted. MHADA can propose development, inclusive of the slum-occupied area, under this regulation.



Residential or residential cum commercial slum dwellers who qualify under this regulation will be provided a tenement with a carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft.). However, in the case of non-residential dwellers, the carpet area would be limited to existing footage or 20.90 sq. m, whichever is lesser.



If a land where slums are located is hindered by reservation, the development of reserved land occupied by slums will adhere to Regulation No 17(3)(C).



A mandatory corpus fund contribution of Rs. 40000 (or an amount determined by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) per Regulation No 33(10)) will be deposited with MHADA Authority for each eligible slum dweller.


# Enhanced Regulations and Conditions for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotment 



This segment explores the allowance of additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to certain categories, primarily focusing on the reconstruction of buildings destroyed by fire or dissolved due to lawful order.



## 33(6)- Additional FSI regarding Reconstruction of buildings destroyed by fire or which have collapsed or which have been demolished under lawful order



Buildings that existed on or after 10th June 1977 and have ceased to exist for certain enumerated reasons shall be granted permission for reconstruction, abiding by the FSI as provided in Regulation No. 30(C). However, if areas under staircases or lifts were not previously delineated as FSI free according to prior Regulation, these areas will be taken into account for determining the protected Built-Up Area (BUA). In such situations, the premium for the entire staircase lift area in the proposed building should be recovered, according to these Regulations.



###   Rebuilding Conditions and Regulations 



The reconstruction of a building on its original plot must adhere to the provisions of the development plan (DP) and these regulations. It must be sanctioned by at least 70% of the previous landlord and occupants of the original building, in accordance with the Mumbai Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947. An agreement signed by the consenting parties must include provisions for the accommodation and rehousing of the landlord and all occupants in the new edifice.



Such agreement must be accompanied by validation from a practicing advocate with a minimum of 10 years' experience. This advocate's certificate should confirm the execution of the reconstruction agreements by the required percentage of landlords and occupants, as well as the authenticity and existence of the occupants' agreements on the date of application.



The carpet area of residential and non-residential premises may be modified with the occupants' consent. However, reconstruction will not be permitted on setback areas or spaces demarked for road broadening. Instead, these areas must be transferred over to the Corporation. These regulations unequivocally exclude buildings entirely occupied by warehouses and godowns.



Buildings reconstructed with the pre-liquidation FSI or BUA must meet the front and marginal open space requirements as per Regulation No.41(5) of these regulations. Despite the contents of these Regulations, any other relaxation included in Regulation No. 33(10) of these regulations, excluding clauses 6.11, 6.15, 6.16, & 6.18, will be applicable. In addition, a premium payment criterion of either 25% of standard premium or 6.25% of land rates as per ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1)- the higher rate will apply.



If the current FSI is inferior to the permissible FSI, the proprietor may choose to develop up to the permissible FSI by availing TDR or additional FSI for a premium under Regulation 30. In cases where the building gets reconstructed using either the Zonal (basic) FSI or allowable FSI, certain regulations will apply, like obligatory open spaces in line with Regulation nos. 41(1) and 41(2) & 43. Moreover, premium applicable for areas outlined in Regulation No.31(1) & 31(3) beyond the existing FSI/BUA should be paid.


# Section 33: Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permission for Certain Categories



The section provides details about the conditions and categories under which additional Floor Space Index (FSI) may be granted.



## Subsection 33(6): FSI Permissions for Reconstructed Buildings Following Destruction or Demolition



Specifically, subsection 33(6) discusses additional FSI permissions given for buildings that have been reconstructed after being destroyed by fire, collapsed, or lawfully demolished.



### Inclusion of Regulation No. 15 in the Context of Reconstructed Buildings



In regards to reconstructed buildings mentioned under subsection 33(6), the provision for Inclusive Housing as stated in Regulation No. 15 must also be considered where applicable.


#  33(7)- Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies or of old buildings belonging to the Corporation



##  Redevelopment Possibilities via Co-operative Housing Societies and Landlords for Cessed and Old Buildings Prior to Sept. 30, 1969



In the context of cooperatively-led reconstruction or redevelopment of older structures within Island City, including cessed buildings existing before September 30, 1969, the applicable Floor Space Index (FSI) can extend up to 3.00 on the gross plot area. This measure applies to projects overseen by the same or differing landlords, Cooperative Housing Societies of landlords/occupiers, or the original tenants. The abovementioned FSI pertains particularly to structures subject to the MHAD Act, 1976, Corporation buildings predating Sept. 30, 1969, or structures initially erected by MHADA under PMGP that are now 30 years old or have been flagged as unsafe by the Competent Authority.



Where the redevelopment or reconstruction is managed by the Co-operative Housing Society of a building's occupiers, provided the building in question has been a cessed property but has evaded payment of cess due to a purchase/acquisition made by the Co-operative Housing Society, the FSI for rehabilitating existing occupants along with the incentive FSI defined in Point 5(c) shall be valid.



##  Construction Permissions and Re-accommodation of Occupants in Cessed and Non-Cessed Buildings



The construction of a new building could be allowed with the irretrievable written agreement from over 51% of the residing occupants in the old building. Every eligible occupant of cessed and non-cessed buildings (dating prior to Sept. 30, 1969) recognized by MBRRB, and existing on plots with only cessed buildings, shall be provided accommodation in the refurbished building.



The rehabilitated occupants will receive an equivalent area to that previously inhabited for living purposes, with a minimum set carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. Ft) and a maximum of 120 sq.m (1292 sq. ft) in accordance with the MHAD Act, 1976. For non-residential use, comparable space from the old building will be provided in the redeveloped structure. 



However, tenants or occupants with residential carpet areas exceeding 120 sq. m will be liable to pay the construction cost for the excess area to the developer at rates set by the ASR/READY RECKONER of the current year. Renovation FSI regulations permit the inclusion of the additional area above 120 sq. m. Alternatively, this area will not be considered for an incentive FSI. Moreover, each eligible residential-cum-commercial occupant is granted the right to a minimum carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq.ft.) in the redeveloped building.


#  Detailed Explanation on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories referring to the Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cessed Buildings in the Island City


##  Rehabilitation Carpet Area, Rules of Tenement Allotment, Reconstruction of Corporation's Buildings, and Policies Concerning Fungible Area



The term rehabilitation Carpet Area pertains to the usable floor area within a tenement, excluding areas covered by walls or any specific areas exempted from the floor space index computation in line with prevailing regulation. This definition includes balcony spaces if allowed to be free of FSI as per the regulation.



For cessed and non-cessed buildings or structures existing before 30th September 1969, a certified list of eligible occupants and their occupied areas must be provided by the Mumbai Repairs and Reconstruction Board. Additionally, the Board verifies the irrevocable written consent as specified.



Landlords or the occupants' co-operative housing societies are responsible for allotting tenements in the reconstructed building following the occupier list authorized by the Mumbai Repairs and Reconstruction Board. The surplus Built-Up Area (BUA) percentage, as noted in the third schedule table of the MHAD Act, 1976, must be made accessible for the Board to house residents in transit camps or cessed buildings unfit for reconstruction, free of charge.



In the scenario of reconstructing or redeveloping corporation buildings that existed before 30th September 1969, the BUA exceeding the area necessary for rehousing existing occupants and incentives on such rehab areas (if any) should be divided between MCGM and the Society of Occupants maintaining a ratio of 1(MCGM): 0.5(Society of Occupants) or a monetary compensation for MCGM's share paid to MCGM, following the municipality's policy.



The applications of Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) on surplus areas handed off to MHADA/MCGM are not permitted for use on sale components. No premiums are charged on the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) concerning the area provided to MHADA/MCGM, and the surplus zone passed to MHADA/MCGM is exempt from the Fungible compensatory BUA if availed.



The stipulation states that the area that matches the market value, according to the ASR/READY RECKONER for the corresponding year, of the area acceptable as per the BUA's prescribed percentage to MHADA can be situated within the same or adjoining municipal ward of MCGM.



The FSI for rehabilitating existing tenants or occupiers in a reconstructed building and incentive FSI can be utilized in the following conditions:






# Section 33: Specifications for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) potentially granted to certain categories



## Subsection 33(7): Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cessed Buildings in the Island City through Co-operative Housing Societies or of Aged Buildings owned by the Corporation



For the redevelopment of cessed buildings present prior to 30th September 1969, led by landlords or Co-operative societies of landlords and Co-operative Housing Societies of landlord / occupants, the maximum Floor Space Index (FSI) shall be 3.00 of the gross plot area. The FSI might be either the FSI necessary for the existing occupants' rehabilitation plus incentive FSI, the bigger of the two. In addition, the occupant is subject to a maximum limit and only eligible for an extra 5% rehabilitation carpet area, as per item 2. The FSI incentive permitted against the required rehabilitation FSI will be calculated based on the Basic Ratio, which is the Land Rate (LR) to Rate of Construction (RC) ratio. The values will be in Rs./sq.m, derived from either the ASR/READY RECKONER or the construction rate applicable to the area. 



# Table 1: Incentive Percentage on Plots based on LR/RC Ratio in accordance with 33(7)- Reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies or old Corporate-owned Buildings


- For plots with a Basic Ratio (LR/RC) greater than 6, the incentive is 75% for a single plot, 85% if it involves two to five plots, and 90% when it comprises six or more plots.


- For plots where the Basic Ratio lies from 4 and up to 6, the incentive is 78% for single plot developments, 88% for developments involving two to five plots, and 95% for developments with six or more plots.


- For plots with a Basic Ratio of up to 4, the rewards rise to 80%, 90%, and 100% for single plot developments, two to five plot developments, and developments with six or more plots, respectively.



Note: *RC and LR, for the purpose of this specification, denote the Rate of Construction for RCC Construction and Land Rate for FSI 1, respectively.



The LR and RC for the Basic Ratio calculation must be based on the year that IOD was issued, regardless of any alterations or modifications that may occur during the completion of the plan. The Basic Ratio remains fixed.



However, it should be noted that if more than one land rate applies to different pieces of the plot under the scheme, a weighted average of all the applicable rates shall be used to determine the Average Land Rate and Basic Ratio. 



Lastly, in cases where the IOD was already issued prior to the implementation of this revised regulation in proposals approved under Regulation 33(7), the LR and the RC for the conversion will be considered as per the ASR/READY RECKONER rates applicable on the date of the conversion.


# Detailed Overview of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Rules & Regulations Applicable in Various Scenarios



##  Elucidating Criteria for Granting Additional Floor Space Index (FSI)



The existing categories may be allowed an additional Floor Space Index (FSI) as per the specified regulations. Among these categories is the provision, 33(7), for the reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City implemented by the Co-operative Housing Societies or pertaining to old buildings owned by the Corporation.



## Provision 5(b): Generous FSI for Amalgamated Redevelopment Undertaken Jointly



Should composite redevelopment be undertaken devising cooperation between landlords or Cooperative societies of landlords and Cooperative Housing Societies jointly for two or more, but not exceeding five plots featuring cessed buildings preceding 30/9/1969, the FSI permissible escalates to 3.00 or the FSI obligatory in delivering the rehab to existing occupiers with added incentive FSI, contingent on column 3 of the previously mentioned table. Additionally, the occupier will also qualify for an 8% increment in rehab Carpet Area under this provision.



## Additional Clauses: Special Provisions Based on the Number of Plots & Municipal Properties in Redevelopment



Variations are further introduced into this provision based on the number of plots involved in the redevelopment or the case of municipal properties' redevelopment. If the number of jointly undertaken plots for redevelopment exceeds six, all having cessed buildings preceding 30/9/1969, or should the redevelopment apply to municipal properties with an eligible tenement density above 650/ha, specific FSI rules are applied. Necessary FSI for rehabilitation and extra incentive FSI, as justified under column 4 of the existing table, may be made available to them. The occupier will benefit from an increase of 15% to their rehab carpet area.



## General Application for Municipal Plots & the Integration of FSI Schemes



The aforementioned provisions 5(a) and 5(b) are generally applicable to municipal plots under reshuffling using this Regulation, with different residential societies on distinct plots involved. In an instance where plots with a 3.00 FSI scheme and an incentive scheme merge for superior planning, the permissible FSI shall be applicable to the individual plots defined under the 5(a) & 5(b) rules.



## Provision 5(c): Special Provisions for Cessed Buildings Redevelopment in Island City



Further specification, as outlined in provision 5(c), occurs if the reconstruction/redevelopment is undertaken by a proposed Cooperative Housing Society of occupiers for buildings existing before 30/9/1969 in Island City. These buildings, previously recognized as cessed buildings under the MHAD Act, 1976 but are now exempted from cess payment due to acquisition by Cooperative Housing Society of Occupiers, the total FSI is set at 2.5 of the gross plot area or the FSI required for rehabilitation12 of existing occupiers plus 50% incentive FSI, whichever prevails.



## On Further Utilization of FSI in Redevelopment



The entire FSI available under Clause 5 shall be allowed to be utilized on the plot or plots under the redevelopment scheme. As an added benefit, an owner or society may choose where to avail the extra FSI, either on the same plot or by taking advantage of the Transferable Development Rights (TDRs) to the extent of the built-up area to be used compliantly with Regulation no. 32.


#  Section 33: Permissible Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Regulation Modifications for Specific Categories



## 33(7) - Advanced Protocols for the Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cessed Buildings in Island City through Cooperative Housing Societies or those Owned by the Corporation



1. The construction or reconstitution of old cessed buildings in reserved zones as listed in the DP is permissible according to Regulation No. 17(3)(B). This includes structures contravening TP Scheme and ones located on roads, which can be incorporated in redevelopment schemes and allowed FSI as per DCR 33(12) or according to these Regulations.


   
2. For composite redevelopment, land with a permissible FSI according to 5(a) and 5(b), the tenure of the plots within it notwithstanding, shall be treated as a single plot.


   
3. Contrary to these Regulations, the relaxations stipulated in subRegulation No. 6 of Regulation No. 33(10)—excepting clauses 6.11, 6.16 & 6.18—apply in the context of building rehabilitation. This requires premium payment at a rate of either 10% of the standard premium or 2.5% of land rates according to ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1), with the higher figure prevailing.



4. Clause No. 6.15, incorporated under subRegulation No. 6 of Regulation No. 33(10), applies.



5. Despite reductions to layout open space (LOS) to ensure project viability, a baseline of 10% open space must still be preserved.



6. 20% of the incentive FSI can be allocated to non-residential purposes under DCPR regulations.



7. When a redevelopment scheme is being undertaken, and a letter of intent has been issued, the owner, developer, or Housing Society can amend the proposal according to modified regulations with prior clearance from the Vice President and CEO of Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority. Although, such changes are optional and non-obligatory.



8. Proposals converted according to this revised regulation, for existing or under-construction buildings above plinth, may seek relief from norms of staircase width and open space with the municipal commissioner's special permission, factors such as street width, number of adjoining roads, and available open spaces being consideration points according to Regulation 6(b).



9. Corporation-owned buildings may be converted with the approval of the Municipal Commissioner, subject to verification of the redevelopment scheme.



10. FSI allowances under these Regulations must have the Commissioner's sanction, provided the Mumbai Repairs and Reconstruction Board confirms that the redevelopment proposal complies with all regulatory conditions for benefits eligibility.



11. For the redevelopment of cessed buildings, exclusions of areas from FSI computation for general buildings mandated in Regulation No. 31(1) are applicable.


# Detailed Specifications Pertaining to Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotment for Certain Categories



## Extra FSI Allowance for Reconstruction or Redevelopment Activities Conducted by Co-operative Housing Societies or Corporation-Owned Buildings


On the subject of redevelopment or reconstruction of cessed buildings within the Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies, or old buildings owned by the Corporation, it is pertinent to note that the permissible FSI, as outlined in clause 5, hinges on the quantity of occupiers along with the actual area occupied by them. Therefore, any new tenancy formulated after June 13, 1996, can't be accommodated. Additionally, any unauthorized constructions within the cessed buildings are not taken into account when computing the prevailing FSI, barring the non-tallying area, excluding illicit construction, authenticated by the MBRRB (MHADA) compliant to the Government U.D. Department's directives of 2002.



A unique provision has been made to facilitate the easy implementation of redevelopment schemes executed by the building's owners or the Co-operative Housing Society of the occupants, permitting the establishment of temporary transition camps on the equivalent land or distinct land owned by the same owner/developer. The concessions permissible under these circumstances align with the SRS project under Regulations 33(10). These transit camps are mandated to be dismantled within a one-month timeframe from the occupation certificate's issuance date, granted by the Corporation for the renovated buildings for the existing tenants/occupants.



In addition to this, an additional development cess amounting to 100% of Development charges on Built-up Area (BUA - sans fungible compensatory area/BUA) or INR 5000 per square meter for BUA beyond rehab BUA will be the responsibility of the owner/developer/society for free sale components. This amount has to be paid to the Corporation following the stipulated payment schedule defined by the Commissioner, MCGM, with the condition that the payment of installments doesn't surpass the construction's completion period. This collected amount is meant to fund a Scheme designed for improving the off-site infrastructure in the vicinity of the development.



According to clause 2, each residential and non-residential occupant's rehabilitative space can only be within the carpet area mentioned in clause 2, and such areas must be explicitly illustrated in the building plan submitted to the Corporation/ MHADA.



There will also be a creation of a corpus fund, as structured by MHADA. Regarding tenements' transfer restrictions, it will be governed by the Rent Control Act provision until a co-operative society is formed, post which the Maharashtra Co-op Society's Act provision will govern it.





#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Particular Categories and Its Implications For Redevelopment Projects



##  Specific FSI Regulations Pertaining to 33(7) Related to Cessed Buildings and Non-Cessed Structures



In the context of the reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City by Cooperative Housing Societies, or the redevelopment of old buildings belonging to the Corporation, special rules apply for the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowance under regulation 33(7). A noteworthy point is the non-deduction of non-cessed structure area in 33(7) schemes for FSI purposes. Specifically, in cases where the structure contains a mix of cessed and non-cessed structures and if the area of the non-cessed structure predates 30/9/69, the land component under the non-cessed structure can account for up to a limit of 45% of plot area. If this percentage is exceeded, then the area exceeding it will be deducted from the plot area. The deducted area will have an FSI as per Regulation No 30 and the remaining plot area will have an FSI in accordance with 33(7). The provisions of clause number 2 are applicable to non-cessed occupiers.



##  Additional FSI Rules for MCGM Owned or Municipal Plots Under Regulation 33(7)



Given that areas partially occupied by slums on MCGM owned or municipal plots/land proposed for development under Regulation 33(7) may be subject to integrated development through this regulation. In line with promoting flexibility, such development initiatives may include the areas occupied by slums existing prior to 1.1.2000 or other government-notified dates. The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) will serve as the Planning Authority for areas declared as slums under section 4 of the Maharashtra Slum Area (Improvement) Act of 1971 on Municipal land with existence dating back before 01.01.2000, or as officially notified by the Government.



##  Criteria for Mixed-Use Tenement Eligibility and Provisions for Non-Residential Slum Dwellings



Per the provisions of Section (b) regarding tenement opportunities for eligible residential or residential cum commercial slum dwellers, they shall be entitled to a tenement of carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft.). In the case of non-residential dwellings, existing or 20.90 sq. m whichever is less is applicable.



##  Corpus Fund and Reservation Regulations for Land Occupied by Slums



In instances where land occupied by slums is affected by reservation, the development of such reservation will be regulated by Regulation Number 17(3)(D). A Corpus Fund shall be established to help with these efforts, requiring a minimum deposit of Rs.40000, or as decided by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) under Regulation 33(10).



##  Essential Provisions for Taller Buildings and Conditions for Clubbing of Schemes



Regardless of exceptions included in these regulations, an existing 9m. road width is mandatory for any building height above 32 m. As for clubbing of schemes, developers or owners have the option of integrating two or more schemes falling under this regulation. For clubbing different plots, it is required that all right holders of these plots agree and submit a joint application. The built-up area of the plot for both rehab and sale components may be clubbed with other plots, agreeing with the aforementioned rule.

## Section 33(7): Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cessed Buildings in Island City by Co-operative Housing Societies or of Old Buildings Belonging to the Corporation



For the reconstruction or redevelopment of cessed buildings in the Island City by co-operative housing societies or old buildings belonging to the corporation, a distinct set of guidelines has been set. 



* The developer is obligated to pay a premium which equals 30% of the difference as per the ASR/READY RECKONER of the plot where clubbing has been granted. 


* This calculated premium is payable to the Planning Authority in two stages, 50% during the issuance of further C.C. above the plinth level and the remaining 50% upon the full C.C. issuance. 



The distribution of the collected premium operates under certain regulations:



* The total premium collected under this regulation is to be split in a 1/3 proportion between the government, MCGM and MHADA. 


* This partitioned amount is then stored in an individual account purposed solely for infrastructure improvement. 



The conditions governing the clubbing of schemes are as follows:



* Clubbing of schemes will only be sanctioned after securing the Commissioner's approval and when he is satisfied with the hardship as per the provisions of the DCPR. 


* Clubbing can be permitted for schemes that fall within a distance of 10 km. 



This segment is a part of a comprehensive guide focusing on the stipulations regarding the additional floor space index (FSI) permitted for certain categories.


# 33(7)(A)- Detailed Overview of Regulations Regarding Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for  Reconstruction or redevelopment of dilapidated/unsafe existing authorized tenant occupied buildings in Suburbs and extended Suburbs and existing authorized non-cessed tenant occupied buildings in Mumbai City. 



The Additional Floor Space Index (FSI), often applicable to specific categories, is an integral aspect of urban planning and development. The discourse below pertains particularly to the regulation 33(7)(A), which addresses the reconstruction or redevelopment of dilapidated and unsafe authorized tenant-occupied buildings situated in the Suburbs, Extended Suburbs, and non-cessed authorized tenant-occupied buildings in Mumbai City. 



The regulation states that for the reconstruction or redevelopment of existing authorized tenant-occupied buildings that are deemed unfit for habitation by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and are legally mandated for demolition due to safety reasons, landlords or Co-operative Housing Societies of existing tenants can leverage the permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) under these regulations and the attached appendix. 



When exclusively tenant-occupied buildings occupy a plot, the allowable FSI equals the FSI necessary for rehabilitating existing legal tenants, supplemented by an additional 50% incentive FSI. Correspondingly, this renders the occupier eligible for an extra 5% rehabilitative carpet area.



In the context of composite development, where the plot comprises a tenant-occupied building along with non-tenanted structures like owner-occupied buildings or existing Co-operative Housing Society buildings, the accessible FSI is equivalent to the FSI required for rehabilitating existing lawful tenants along with a 50% incentive FSI. This FSI further incorporates the FSI already authorized and utilized by the non-tenanted buildings or structures.



Further provisions also apply to composite redevelopments for two to five plots of tenant-occupied buildings, for which the incentive FSI increases to 60%, with the occupier qualifying for an additional 8% rehabilitative carpet area. For developments involving six or more plots, the incentive FSI increases to 70%, and the occupier becomes eligible for an extra 15% rehabilitation carpet area.





## An Overview of Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Existing Authorized Tenant-occupied Buildings in Suburbs and Extended Suburbs and Non-cessed Tenant-occupied Buildings in Mumbai City



1. The F.S.I. allowable for new constructions as part of the reconstruction or redevelopment of authorized, tenant-occupied buildings, under the scope of subregulation 33(7)(A), will follow the regulations outlined in Regulation No.33(7)(A).


2. (a) A new building's establishment can only be authorised if more than 51% of the existing building's tenants provide irrevocable written consent. 


(b) All tenants from the old building must receive accommodation in the redeveloped structure.



3. Each tenant's rehabilitation process requires providing them with the carpet area from their resident occupancy in the previous building. This provided area should adhere to a minimum fixed carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft) and/or a maximum area of 120 sq. m (1292 sq. ft) free of cost. For non-residential occupants, the area given in the reconstructed building must be equivalent to previously occupied space in the old structure. 



Additional provisions clarify that if the carpet area for residential purposes surpasses 120 sq. m (1292 sq. ft), the tenant will be held responsible for construction costs to the developer as per the ready reckoner rate of that year. However, any carpet area beyond this limit isn't considered for either rehabilitation FSI or incentive FSI. 



Distinctly, a residential cum commercial occupant is entitled to a tenement with a minimum of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft.) carpet area. 



For clarity purposes, the existing Carpet area or rehabilitation “carpet area” is defined as the net usable floor area within a tenement, excluding wall-covered area or any other area specifically exempted from FSI computation as per regulation. However, it includes the areas of the balcony if allowed free of FSI as the regulation dictates. It's important to note that this regulation isn't applicable for non-tenanted buildings. 



No new tenancy starting after 13/6/96 will be honoured. Further, any unauthorized constructions made in buildings oriented towards creating new tenancies within the existing ones won't be considered during computations of the existing FSI. The existence of tenements before 13/6/96 can be proven through a certified inspection extract of the Municipal Corporation for the year 1995-96 or by presenting a Court Order, which will be considered sufficient evidence. 



Additionally, the tenant list along with an area estimation for each tenant's occupancy in the old building, including the irrevocable written consent as defined in guideline 2(a), will require certification from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. 



The newly constructed building's tenements will be allotted by the landlord/s or Co-operative Housing Societies of the existing tenants according to the certified list from the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai.



The entire FSI available under these regulations should be utilized on plot/plots as part of the redevelopment scheme. 



Lastly, the new building's reconstruction must strictly conform to the provisions of the development plan and these regulations.


# Section 33: Supplementary Floor Space Index Regulations for Certain Categories



## 33(7)(A): Guidelines for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Certain Existing Authorized Buildings



Approved reconstruction or redevelopment efforts must be targeted towards dilapidated, unsafe but currently inhabited buildings in Mumbai City, as well as the suburbs and extended suburbs. Work on areas designated for set-back or road widening is strictly prohibited, and these sections must be ceded to the Municipal Corporation. 



The Full Space Index (FSI) calculation for the aforementioned properties considers the entire plot or layout area, inclusive of Development Plan roads and internal roads, but excluding lands earmarked for public amenities. 



All new buildings reconstructed under these regulations are expected to comply with these and all other rules and orders as becomes applicable subsequently. The Municipal Commissioner reserves the right to condone minute variances in these redevelopment projects under Regulation No. 6.



Incentive FSI is given, of which 20% is usable for non-residential purposes, permitted as per the DCPR. Bare areas, or those denoted as Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA), are invoked in the rehabilitation component without a premium. The FCA is prohibited from use for free sale and must be dedicated exclusively to existing tenants as a bonus to their eligible area.



Implementation of redevelopment projects led by landlords or Co-operative Housing Societies of existing tenants may necessitate temporary transit camps, allowed either on the same land or another property owned by the same landlords. Concessions are granted under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS) project under Regulations 33(10). Note that such transit camps must be torn down within one month from the occupation certificate issuance date by the Corporation for the reconstructed buildings.



Landlords or societies of existing tenants also bear a responsibility to contribute an additional development cess of Rs.5000/- per sq. m for the built-up area above the permissible FSI, as stipulated in table 12 under Regulation 30. This obligation pertains to both the rehabilitation and free-sale components. The Municipal Corporation will receive these payments according to a temporally-defined schedule set by the Municipal Commissioner, MCGM. The payment schedule, however, is not allowed to extend beyond the construction completion. Collected funds will be applied towards a scheme specifically designed to boost off-site infrastructure in the surrounding area of the development. The development cess is increased by 10% every three years.



According to clause 3, each residential/non-residential tenant is entitled to rehabilitation in a carpet area explicitly mentioned in clause 3. The building plans submitted to the Municipal Corporation must prominently feature these areas.

(33 - Legal Clauses, Codes, and Regulations Specific to Housing Development in Mumbai Region)



## **33(7)(A) - Architecture and Building prerequisites for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Authorized Tenant-Occupied Buildings**



Clause 33(7)(A) dictates the prerequisites for the reconstruction or redevelopment of dilapidated or unsafe existing authorized tenant-occupied buildings in Mumbai's Suburbs and extended Suburbs. This clause also applies to existing authorized non-cessed tenant-occupied buildings in Mumbai City itself. 



Should landlords or Co-operative Housing Societies of existing tenants initiate reconstruction or redevelopment work following the demolition of a building, they must do so within the period of one year from the demolition date. Moreover, they are required to finish the reconstruction or redevelopment project in a span of five years.



Landlords and Co-operative Housing Societies are tasked with providing alternate accommodation for their tenants during the redevelopment or reconstruction process. Furthermore, they must establish a corpus fund designated to maintaining the building for a duration of ten years.



The regulations on the transfer of tenements are guided initially by the provisions of the Rent Control Act until a Co-operative Society has been established. Following the formation of the Co-operative Society, the rules become guided by the provisions of the Maharashtra Co-operative Society's Act.



## **Provisions for Using Additional Floor Space Index (FSI)**



According to the housing development regulations, if the rehabilitation, plus incentives as per the regulation, is less than the permissible FSI under regulation 30, the owner can choose to develop up to the permissible FSI by making use of Transferable Development Rights (TDR) or Additional FSI. However, this is possible only upon the successful payment of a premium at a 50% rate of a normal premium under Regulation 30.



## **Relaxation Rules for Construction and Other Requirements in Redevelopment**



In rehabilitation scenarios, despite what might be outlined in existing Regulations, clause 6 of Regulation 33(10) offers certain relaxations. Exceptions are clauses 6.11, 6.16, and 6.18 not being covered by these relaxations. Notably, payment of a premium at the rate of 10% of the ordinary premium or at the rate of 2.5% of the land rates as per ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1), whichever amount is higher, is mandatory.


# 33(7)(B)- Additional Floor Space Index(FSI) for Redevelopment of existing residential housing societies excluding buildings covered under regulation 33(7) and 33(7)(A)



## Focused on Redevelopment of Existing Residential Housing Societies  



Redevelopment of existing residential housing societies, barring the structures encompassed under regulation 33(7) and 33(7)(A), by either housing societies or land lords, will be incentivized with additional Built-Up Area (BUA) equivalent to 15% of the existing BUA or 10 sq. m per tenement, depending on the greater value. This provision applies only when the redevelopment does not include any premium or additional costs.  



Moreover, if the present authorized BUA and incentives derived from it are still less than the permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) in accordance with regulation 30(A)(1), then the society can acquire 'Additional FSI', payment of which involves premium/TDR, until it reaches the FSI limit. 



In cases where areas like the staircase, lift & lift lobby have been claimed as FSI free, subject to a premium charge according to the prevailing regulation, the FSI exemption extends only to an equivalent extent without the need for a premium. Similarly, if these areas were previously included in the FSI, an incentive, additional FSI similar to what is mentioned in Sr. No 1, will be applicable on such areas. These areas can be claimed as FSI exempt by charging a premium according to these regulations. 



This regulation applies only when the intention is to re-accommodate the existing members of the societies. The legality of this regulation pertains specifically to the redevelopment of existing authorized buildings that are thirty years old or more. 



The regulation does not apply to redevelopment proposals that fall under Regulation numbers 33(5), 33(7), 33(8), 33(9), 33(9)(A), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10) (A), 33(20) (A), or 33(21). 



The age of a building is calculated from the 1st of January of the year in which a redevelopment proposal is submitted to the Commissioner. The age is determined from the Occupation Certificate's date or, alternatively, from the first date of assessment under property tax, pertaining to that specific building.



The provision, allowing incentive additional BUA, operates independently from additional BUA permitted under Regulation Nos. 14(A), 15, 16, and 17. 



The fungible area, also referred to as Fungible Compensatory Area or Fungible Area (FCA), permitted under Regulation No. 31(3) upon existing authorized BUA, does not require a premium. The incentive additional BUA, conversely, involves a premium. 



Regulation 33(7)(B) applies in cases of mixed-residential plots where tenanted buildings and buildings of co-operative housing society/non- tenanted building coexist. The land corresponding to the BUA of the existing tenanted building should be developed according to Regulation No 33(7)(A), whereas the remainder of the notional plot should abide by this regulation.


# 33(8)- Detailed Regulation on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zone (SDZ)



## Regulation Applicability pertaining to Private Land within Special Development Zone (SDZ)



The additional FSI provisions of this Regulation apply specifically to an uncontiguous, unbroken and uninterrupted territory of land, at least 2.0 ha in area and permissible for development under the existing laws and regulations. If a landowner's plot area is less than 2 ha, they can participate by collectively creating parcels of 2 ha or larger with others and propose development according to these Regulations. Development sanctioning is under the sole discretion of the Municipal Commissioner, who acts with prior governmental approval.



## Planning and Proposal Submission Essentials 



The property owner should formulate and submit the proposal, addressing the infrastructure requisites such as roadways, water supply, sewerage and storm water drainage systems. In addition, the plot area for Public Open Spaces (POS), Affordable Housing (AH), Other Amenities (OA) like Education, Health & Social Amenities, and owners land share must be clearly marked. In instances where the sections delegated for OA/POS/AH don't adjoin a municipal road, uninterrupted access should be provisioned as detailed in Regulation No 23(1) Table no.7. The remaining land after road and access areas deduction will be appropriately apportioned among the Owner’s Share, Affordable Housing (AH), POS, and OA. Roads and continued access routes will be surrendered to MCGM, qualifying for additional Built-Up Area (BUA) in relation to the surrendered/transferred land area over and above FSI as detailed in the subsequent section. 



### Distribution of Plot Area 



The Proposed development plan must outline the distribution of available area among AH, POS, OA, and other developments. For plots measuring 2 ha & up to 4 ha, the allocation is 30% for Affordable Housing, 15% for Public Open Spaces, 14% for Other Amenities, and 41% for Other Developments. Plots exceeding 4 ha should allocate 30% for Affordable Housing, 15% for Public Open Spaces, 12% for Other Amenities, and 43% for Other Developments. 



The owner is responsible for accurately marking the various areas in their proposal. Specific sections for other amenities including education, health, and social amenities will be determined by the Commissioner based on the prescribed minimum amenity standards. 



All territories excluding the owner's share as demonstrated in the table above, are to be handed over to MCGM upon approval of the layout. The ownership is required to be transferred to MCGM within a year from the approval date or commencement of the owner's share development, whichever comes first. 



Landowners are granted the choice of developing AH and OA, which once completed, are handed over to MCGM. Also, areas separated for POS, AH, and OA are to be evened, with construction of boundaries incorporated before submission to MCGM.


# Detailed Guidance on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Distinct Categories: Focusing on Construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zone (SDZ)



- The **development process for affordable housing (AH) and open area (OA) in a Special Development Zone (SDZ)** must comply with the specifications prescribed by the Commissioner. It should be completed within three years following the approval of the individual building plans for AH and OA, subject to potential extension granted by the Commissioner for valid, recorded reasons.


- The **applicability of providing amenities under Regulation No. 14(A) and 15 is excluded for developments undertaking this Regulation**.


- The **carpet areas for the tenements to be constructed should be designated for Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Low-Income Group (LIG) and Middle-Income Group (MIG)**. Yet, this may be subject to changes as decided by the Government periodically, ensuring a minimum of 25 square meters.


- A customary **15% of the owner's land should be allotted for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) according to Regulation No.27 on Affordable Housing (AH) plots**. This means that a cumulative 25% of the entire holding should be assigned for Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) if one includes the POS handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the owner's share of the AH plot.


- For Infrastructure Development, it is the **responsibility of the owner to develop the infrastructure network** (roads, water supply mains, sewer line, storm water drain, and street lights) within the layout relating to the specified scheme (AH, POS, and OA). This infrastructure should then be handed over to the MCGM for management.


- If **an owner decides against developing Affordable Housing (AH) and Open Area (OA)**, they are entitled to an FSI 1.0 of the gross plot on the owner's shared land. This plot consists of the AH, POS, OA, the area covered under the to-be-transferred road to the MCGM, and the land that forms the Owner’s share of the specific scheme.


- If the owner decides to develop AH and OA, they will be given a **gross plot FSI of 1 and the cost of construction** in the form of Built-Up Area (BUA) as discussed in Clause (E) (a). The owner will also be compensated for the development of non-proprietary infrastructure.


- The acknowledgement of the **plot given for AH development will take place at an FSI 2.5 of the AH area**, while the plot assigned for OA will receive an FSI of 2. There should be structural provisions for vertical extension for the consumption of FSI up to 4 on the OA plot.


- The constructed Affordable Housing (AH) tenements & amenities have to be handed over to MCGM. The **cost of construction for the AH tenements & amenities will be compensated in the form of BUA.**


- 'Transfer of Development Rights' (TDR) or ‘Additional FSI on payment of premium’ according to Regulation No. 30(1)(A) [excluding Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) as mentioned in Regulation No. 31(3)], will not be permissible on the owner's share of the land.


# 33. Protocols for Granting Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories Including Construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zones (SDZ)



## Section 33(8): Regulations regarding Construction within Affordable Housing in Special Development Zones (SDZ)


1. The land given to the MCGM for Open Area (OA) shall not be developed under Accommodation Reservation (AR) as laid out in Regulation No 17. It is mandated that this land must be used solely for the designated purpose as per these regulations.


2. Despite the stipulations in these regulations, residential or commercial uses that are permissible, regardless of the width of the adjoining road, shall be allowed within the Owner's share of the land. Furthermore, 15% of the permissible FSI on Affordable Housing (AH) plots should be reserved exclusively for convenient shops.


3. No charges or premiums for development will be levied for relaxations in open spaces, exclusion of staircase, lift, and lobby areas from FSI computation, or for Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) as per Regulation No. 31(3) for Built-Up Area (BUA) that is to be handed over to the MCGM.


4. A Development cess amounting to 7% of the Land Rate (for FSI 1) for the BUA (bar Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area(FCA)) to be constructed on the owner's share of land as per the ASR/READY RECKONER for the year of approval is payable to the MCGM. This cess is to be added to the already levied development charges as per section 124 of the MR&TP Act 1966.



## Terms of Compensation for Development of Infrastructure Lands Handover to MCGM and BUA Construction


1. The property owner will be entitled to Building Up Area (BUA) on the expense of creating Affordable Housing (AH)/Built-Up Amenities. This includes the complete development of infrastructure for the MCGM land portion, equating to 2.0 times the rate of development per square meter as per ASR/Ready Reckoner ratios and the BUA of all amenities and all Affordable Housing (AH).  


2. For calculation purposes, the ratio of BUA to carpet area should be taken as 1.2 according to these regulations.


3. Area designated for staircase/lift in Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities should not be counted towards the overall FSI/BUA and won't be charged with a premium fee.


4. The Commencement Certificate for over 75% of the permissible BUA will not be granted until the infrastructure development across the entire layout and the construction of Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities has been fully completed and occupation has been permitted.


5. The Commencement Certificate for over 75% of the permissible BUA can be released once the Occupation Certificate for Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/ Amenities has been granted.


6. The BUA corresponding to the development of infrastructure and construction of Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities, can infiltrate the real estate market on the basis of a 0.50 sale (incentive) area: 1 Affordable Housing (AH)/Amenity area. This process shall progress simultaneously in the indicated proportion. However, the total incentivised area in lieu of Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities & infrastructure development can be released only after the completion of Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities as elaborated above.


# Regulation Overview: Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Select Categories and Construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zone (SDZ)



## Section 33(8) FSI Limitations and TDR Provisions for Affordable Housing Construction in SDZs


For construction projects aiming to build affordable housing in Special Development Zones (SDZs), the consumption of Floor Space Index (FSI) on the owner’s land share shall not exceed 4 units. There is a provision for allowing Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) as a substitute for unconsumed incentive Built-Up Area (BUA), which is directly related to the completion and handover of designated Affordable Housing (AH) tenements/Amenities. This preferential option rests with the owner or developer. However, it's noteworthy that a portion of the TDR assignable for unconsumed BUA, amounting to 20%, gets released only after the entire AH tenements/amenities area gets handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM).



## Constraints and Approvals for Government / Semi-Government / Other Authorities' Lands in SDZs


When it comes to land owned by Government/Semi- Government/Appropriate Authority within the SDZs, the provision of Regulation 33(8) applies to unbroken, contiguous land segments which span no less than 2.0 hectares, and is not disqualified from development due to other binding regulations or laws. All such proposals must bear the prior approval of the Government.



## Submitting Proposals: Infrastructure Considerations, Land Apportionment and Requirements


For the submission of a proposal, multiple factors need consideration. Aside from quantifying demands for infrastructure components such as roads, water supply, sewerage and storm water drains, there is a necessity for defining areas designated for Public Open Spaces (POS), Affordable Housing (AH), Other Amenities (OA), and land for other developments i.e. Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority’s share of land. If OA/POS and AH are not positioned bordering the municipal road, an uninterrupted access?



## Plot Area-wise Apportionment of Land for Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority’s Share, Affordable Housing (AH), POS, and OA


The following table provides the plot area-wise distribution of land across different categories:



- For plots not less than 2 hectares & up to 4 hectares, the distribution stands at 30% for Affordable Housing, 15% for Public Open Spaces, 14% for Other Amenities, and 41% for Other Development.


- For plots over 4 hectares, the distribution is 30% designated for Affordable Housing, 15% for Public Open Spaces, 12% for Other Amenities, 43% for Other Development.



Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authorities need to submit their proposals adhering to the above distribution standards to the MCGM Commissioner. Apart from distinct marking for allocated lands for Affordable Housing (AH), POS, OA and Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority’s share, further earmarking for facilities like education, health and social amenities will be handled by the Commissioner, following the standards prescribed as the minimum requirement.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories and Construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zones



In context of construction of Affordable Housing in Special Development Zones (SDZ), the advance possession of all lands, excluding those of the Government/SemiGovernment/Appropriate Authority, should be transferred to Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) at the time of layout approval. The property ownership should be legally transferred to MCGM within a year from having advance possession or from seeking the commencement certificate for the development of the land owned by Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority.



Certain authorities are designated to hand over the land reserved for Public Open Spaces (POS) and Open Areas (OA) to MCGM following the leveling of the land and the construction of compound wall. It is noteworthy that the amenities laid out in Regulation 14(A) and 15 are not required for developments under this regulation.



The constructed tenements should be aimed at Economically Weaker Sections(EWS), Lower Income Group (LIG) and Middle Income Group(MIG) or as specified by the Government, ensuring a minimum carpet area of 25 sq.m.



In terms of layout, a provision of 15% Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) should be available on Affordable Housing (AH) plot and Government-owned share of land. With this arrangement, a cumulative 25% LOS of the entire landholding is reached when considering POS and proprietor's share of land/AH plot. 



## Infrastructure Development



In terms of infrastructure, certain authorities must develop an infrastructure network within the layout consisting of Affordable Housing (AH), POS & OA. This layout should be transferred to MCGM, which includes the road, water supply mains, sewer lines, stormwater drain, and streetlights pertaining to that specific structure, as per the requirements of the concerned departments. 



When it comes to permissible Floor Space Index (FSI), appointed authorities like the Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority are eligible for an FSI 1 of the entire plot area, taking into account Affordable Housing (AH), POS, OA, and the area covered under roads. This FSI is granted on conditions different from other Developments. 



The plot set aside for Affordable Housing (AH) can be developed by these authorities with an FSI of 2.5 on the AH plot. If this is the case, a premium for the Built-up Area (BUA) is charged at 60% of the land rate as per the ASR/READY RECKONER (for FSI 1). However, this is not applicable if the development is undertaken by the State Government & MCGM themselves. These tenements should be made available for the public as per the Affordable Housing (AH) policy.  



Open Areas (OA) can be developed as per the requirements of MCGM and as per these Regulations. The Municipal Commissioner's decision regarding OA development is final and binding. 



It's important to highlight that Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) or 'Additional FSI on payment of premium' is not applicable, except for Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA).


#  Extra Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotments for Specific Categories


##  Building Affordable Housing in Special Development Zones (SDZs)



The first point to note is that land allocated to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) for open spaces (OA), as previously mentioned, is prohibited from development according to the Affordable Regulations (AR) formula specified in Regulation No. 17. This land must be used entirely and exclusively for the purposes dictated by these regulations.



Secondly, despite the provisions in these regulations, it should be noted that residential and commercial uses that are normally allowed, regardless of the width of the road they are adjacent to, will also be allowed on the land shared by the Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority. Particularly, 15% of the acceptable FSI on an Affordable Housing (AH) plot should be strictly reserved for the establishment of convenience stores that cater to the residential occupants of the layout.



The third point stipulates the charging of a development cess, calculated as 7% of the Land Rate (for FSI 1) for the Built-Up Area (BUA). This does not include the Fungible Area, Fungible Compensatory Area, or Fungible Area (FCA). This charge is applicable to any construction on the shared land of the Government/Semi-Government/Appropriate Authority, based on either the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR) or the READY RECKONER from the year when the approval was granted. This amount is to be paid to MCGM.





# 33(9)- Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed for Reconstruction or redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS)



##  33(9): Details on CDS in the Island City of Mumbai



In the Island City of Mumbai, the reconstruction or redevelopment of Cluster(s) of buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s), also abbreviated as CDS, can be undertaken by MHADA or MCGM either departmentally or through a suitable agency (scenario 'a'). Alternately, it could be facilitated jointly by MHADA/MCGM alongside land owners and/or Co-op. Housing Societies of tenants/occupiers of buildings and/or Co-op. Housing Society of hutment dwellers (scenario 'b'). This redevelopment can also be pursued independently or through a Promoter/Developer by the land owners and/or Co-op. Housing Society of tenants/occupiers of buildings and/or Co-op Housing Society of hutment dwellers (scenario 'c'). For such an undertaking, the FSI shall be maxed at 4.00 or the FSI necessary to accommodate the rehabilitation of existing tenants/occupiers. This includes additional incentive FSI if it exceeds the capped 4.0 FSI, as per the provisions of this Regulation.



## An Expanded Definition of a Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)


A Cluster Development Scheme, or CDS for short, encapsulates any plan that focuses on the redevelopment of a cluster of buildings and structures. This stands true for a minimum area of 4000 sq. m in the Island City of Mumbai and 6000 sq. m in Mumbai Suburbs & Extended Suburbs. These clusters are typically surrounded by existing physical boundaries such as roads, nallas, and railway lines, etc. They must be accessible via an existing or proposed D.P. road that is a minimum of 18 m wide. This road can exist in current terms or proposed in the D.P. or URP. It could also be a road for which a Sanctioned Regular line of street has been ordained by the MCGM under the MMC Act, 1888.



Cluster Development (CD) is often synonymous with identified clusters or groups of clusters earmarked for urban renewal. In exceptional circumstances, after verifying traffic simulation studies, HPC might consider allowing CDS on a plot that has access from a pre-existing minimum 12m wide dead-end road, which stems from an 18 m wide public road. 



The Commissioner can consider the approval of CDS on a plot with access from an existing 12.0 Mt. road, but this depends on the availability of an 18.30 M. arterial road within a vicinity of 500 M. from the Scheme. 



## The Cluster Development Plan (CDP)


The Cluster Development Plan or CDP, is prepared Commissioner for the concerned area who reserves the right to revise the same whenever necessary. Alternatively, well-defined clusters covered in the Development Plan (DP) can be handled by the Promoter of the CDS. 



However, it's crucial to note that no cluster or clusters shall be identified for redevelopment or the implementation of CDS by the Municipal Commissioner without conducting an Impact Assessment Study. This study should evaluate the impact on the city and sector-level infrastructure and amenities, traffic, and the environment attributed to the implementation of CDS on such cluster or clusters.



##Explanation:


The land under CDS is treated as one plot regardless of the tenure of the plots found therein. This applies explicitly for the purpose of computing FSI and marginal distances.


# Detailed Explanation of Extra Floor Space Index (FSI) for Reconstruction or Redevelopment under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



## Clause 33(9): Guidelines for Cluster Development Scheme for Building Reconstruction or Redevelopment



A Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) allows for a variety of strategic redevelopment or reconstruction in certain instances. In regard to the amalgamation or subdivision of plots, upon approval of CDS, any land proposed or considered under this scheme on various C.S. or CTS or F.P. Numbers will be given natural amalgamation status for the scheme's purpose. This action won't require separate approval for amalgamation of lands.



The perimeters and area of the proposed CDS will be decided based on an approved layout. The City Survey Officer, following the actual on-site CDS measurement, must authenticate these details. These boundaries and area will be employed for planning purposes. However, if necessary, these areas may undergo further subdivision, which can create specific plots or sectors assigned for planning, surrendering reservations, amenities, realigned roads, etc., to MCGM or the appropriate authority. 



For lands with different tenures, only one PRC will not be insisted. Necessary entries concerning CDS, however, will be recorded in the respective PRC. When a CDS does not have clearly defined perimeters by roads or water channels or railway lines, the jurisdiction of this Cluster may be determined by the Municipal Commissioner. 



## Distinctive Characteristics of a Cluster Development (CD)



A CD could include a diverse mix of structures, including:


Buildings in the Island City that are at least 30 years old and are either acquired or rebuilt by MHADA under MHAD Act, 1976.


Additional structures that have been reconstructed by MHADA and are less than 30-years-old potentially, provided that the HPC/Municipal Commissioner has taken them into consideration following a specific MHADA recommendation.



Buildings owned by the Central Government, the State Government, SemiGovt Organizations or the MCGM that are at least 30 years old. These types comprise institutional edifices, offices, rented municipal buildings, and facilities erected by MHADA.


Land possessed by the State Government, any semi-government organization, MCGM, or MHADA. These lands could be vacant or constructed upon. They fall within the jurisdiction of the proposed CDS, including those leased or given on the tenure of Occupant Class II. 



Regardless, any proposed inclusion of these buildings or lands under the CDS would have to come after acquiring the concerned Department's prior consent.


# Detailed Clarifications on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS) 



## Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Building Clusters under Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)



Certain classifications of buildings may become eligible for additional Floor Space Index (FSI) when considering redevelopment. In particular, buildings unfit for human habitation due to disrepair or structural/sanitary defects. These problematic buildings may also pose safety risks to inhabitants because of their poor configuration or constricted location in narrow streets. Such unfitness or safety hazards need to be confirmed by MHADA/MCGM or Mumbai Repair & Reconstruction Board officials or appropriately appointed agency.



## FSI Considerations for Slum Areas under Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS)



Slum areas declared under section 4 of Slum Act, or those established on public lands before 1st January 2000 or any other such reference date given by the government, may be eligible for additional FSI. An essential condition here is that these slum areas should not make up more than 50% of the area under consideration for a Cluster Development Scheme.



## Exclusion of Areas from FSI calculation in the Context of Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS)



Certain areas that have been previously developed or are currently undergoing development under different provisions of the DCPR may be included in a CDS for planning purposes only. Importantly, these areas will not contribute to the calculation of the FSI permitted under this regulation. The allowable FSI would be determined according to the relevant DCPR provisions that the areas are developed under or are currently being developed. It becomes a mandatory protocol to obtain the consent of the concerned area owners before their inclusion into the Cluster Development Scheme.


# Detailed Documentation on the Authorization of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories



## Guideline for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under the Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)



The following conditions apply to the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that may be allowed for reconstruction or redevelopment under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS). A critical rule to note is that no new tenancies created after June 13, 1996, will be deemed valid. Additionally, any unauthorized construction made in buildings for creating new tenancy in existing tenancies will be dismissed while calculating the existing FSI. 



Documentary evidence like a certified inspection extract from the Municipal Corporation for the years 1995-96, or a Court Order verifying the existence of tenements prior to June 13, 1996, is considered sufficient proof to establish the number of tenancies. The government may further provide comprehensive guidelines to help determine the eligibility of occupiers and tenants. 



The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) is responsible for certifying the list of occupants and the area each of them occupies in municipal buildings. As part of this certification process, the irrevocable written consents of all occupants are required. The Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board (MBRRB) performs a similar certification process for all occupants in other non-slum buildings, with the requirement of irrevocable written consent being outlined in clause 4(a).



Exceptions exist in these regulations for mezzanine floors with a clear height of 1.8 meters and above, constructed prior to June 13, 1996 and subsequently regularized, or those assessed by MCGM and reflected in the Inspection Extract of the year 1995-1996. These floors qualify for rehabilitation and incentive FSI. 



However, it should be noted that obligatory charges for the regularization of the mezzanine floor are recoverable and necessary conditions to this effect will be included in the Intimation of Disapproval (IOD).


# Detailed Explanation of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted for Certain Categories



The concept of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) refers to the additional space that may be granted to certain categories of structures. There exists a particular rule, rule number 33(9), which focuses on the reconstruction or redevelopment of Clusters of Buildings under the Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS). 



The term 'Protected Occupiers' is detailed in Chapter IE of the Slum Act and corresponding orders issued in alignment with this act. These 'Protected Occupiers' are recognised and certified by the legally appointed authority.



In the context of these guidelines, the term 'structure' has a unique definition. It includes all the dwelling areas belonging to individuals who are listed as residents in one numbered house, as per the electoral roll of the most recent date, extending upto 1st January 2000 or any other reference date that the Government officially notifies. This definition is independent of the total number of residents, the placement of rooms or access points.


# Section 33: Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Considerations for Specific Categories


## Subsection 33(9): Reconstructing or Redeveloping Clusters of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



The Promoter of the Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) is encouraged to consolidate lands belonging to various parties, including public entities, under the proposed CDS umbrella. Should the relevant public authority give consent or permission for their lands to be included in the CDS in exchange for any form of compensation, the decision on such proposals would fall within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Commissioner. Such proposals are not required to be submitted to the empowered committee.



If the promoter intends to incorporate any building or land owned by the State Government, MCGM, MHADA, or any agency under state control (collectively referred to as Public Authority), a formal request must be submitted through the Municipal Commissioner to an Empowered Committee (EC) led by the Chief Secretary. This committee is formed by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM).



The EC will review the promoter's request considering the desirability of allocating public authority-owned land for the CDS. The EC can set the conditions for transferring such land to the promoter for CDS purposes. If the desired land belongs to an authority established by or under a statute, the EC's decision must be confirmed/approved by such authority.



Such land can be exchanged for a land of similar or higher value based on the ASR/READY RECKONER land rate standards.



The promoter has the right to secure Development Rights (DRs) over the consolidated lands via registered documents, on the condition that the area holding the DRs will be considered a single plot for all purposes under the Development Control and Promotion Regulation (DCPR).



Alternatively, all lands under the CDS can be transferred to a legal entity (such as a Registered Society, Company, Co-operative Housing Society, Charitable Trust, etc.) that the promoter establishes. In such a case, the various landholders' stakes would be proportional to their shares in the total CDS land.



The promoter can also acquire lands, provided they have purchased or procured these.


# In-depth Analysis of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Specific Categories and Reconstruction Schemes



## Detailed Provisions for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s)



The Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) permits the reconstruction or redevelopment of buildings on a minimum of 70% land in the Cluster Development (CD). If there exist dangerous buildings (as declared by a Competent Authority) on the remaining lands within the CD, the promoter may seek the Higher Power Committee's (HPC) recommendation for acquiring such lands. When such a request is made, HPC can suggest to the government which lands should be procured for CDS purposes after conducting a proper examination. Following this, it is the Government's responsibility to follow the necessary steps to acquire the recommended balance lands as per the relevant law and legally transfer the same to the promoter purely for implementing the CDS. The promoter must deposit the required amount for such land acquisition with the Government. In this context, a Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) is viewed as a public purpose for the purpose of land acquisition.



## Requirements for Redevelopment or Reconstruction under CDS and Rights of Eligible Tenants



Redevelopment or reconstruction permission under the Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) may be granted following an irrevocable notarized written consent by eligible tenants/occupiers of no less than 51% of each building or a 60% overall consent of the scheme involved in CDS. There is no requirement for tenants/occupiers' approval for reconstruction or redevelopment if the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) intends to undertake redevelopment on their land directly without involving any developer. The Developer needs to provide a proof of ownership or procurement of Development Rights (DRs) for at least 70% of the land under proposed CDS along with the CDS proposal (the Municipal Roads are not included if maintained as existing in proposed CDS). The developer is also obliged to present evidence of ownership or procurement of development rights for the remaining area within one year from the Letter of Intent (LOI) issue date. 



All eligible occupants/tenants of a building undergoing redevelopment must be given accommodation in the redeveloped building(s) as a requirement.


# Detailed Guidelines on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allocation for Specific Categories Under 33(9) - Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS)



The markdown document addresses the subject of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) permitted for certain categories under the provision 33(9) - Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS). Specifically, it focuses on the basis of allocating carpet area to occupants or tenants during a redevelopment process.



In the context of redevelopment or reconstruction of clusters of buildings, every occupant or tenant is entitled to be rehoused with a property of a carpet area that matches the area they occupied in the old building. This rule also applies for non-residential properties. The premise allocated post rehabilitation is identified as the basic area.



In the case of residential or combined residential and commercial occupants, the carpet area allocated should not fall below a minimum of 35.00 square meters. The document further defines an “additional area” which is additional space allocated for rehabilitation of residential or combined residential and commercial Occupants. This additional space depends on the size of the Cluster Development (CD).



## Description of Additional Areas based on Cluster Development Size - Table A



This table outlines the allocation of additional area over and above the basic area based on the plot size or the area of cluster development for clause 33(9) - Reconstruction or Redeployment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under the Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS).



1. For a Cluster Development area that ranges above 4000 Square Meters and up to 5000 Square Meters, an additional area of 10% over and above the basic area will be provided.


2. Cluster Developments measuring above 5000 Square Meters and up to 1 Hectares qualify for a 15% increase in additional area over and above the basic area.


3. For Cluster Development sizes between above 1 Hectares and up to 2 Hectares, a 20% increase in additional area over the basic area is allowed.


4. An additional area increase of 25% above the basic area is granted for Cluster Development sizes that are above 2 Hectares and up to 5 Hectares.


5. Cluster Developments from above 5 Hectares up to 10 Hectares are eligible for a 30% increase in additional area over and above the basic area.


6. Any Cluster Development above 10 Hectares is allotted an additional area increase of 35% over and above the basic area.



It must be noted that in situations where the original carpet area of a property in the old building measures 100 square meters or more, the tenant is only eligible for additional area based on the limits of a carpet area of 100 square meters.





# Detailed Explanation of the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Certain Categories and Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)


This section provides a detailed understanding of the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) regulations that may be applicable to particular categories and circumstances. It specifically focuses on the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of buildings under the Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) as indicated in the 33(9) subsection.



Strict provisions govern the rehabilitation entitlement of occupants in commercial establishments. If the High Power Committee (HPC) approves, these occupants can be rehabilitated in a residential tenement, replacing their commercial establishment. These provisions mirror the rules for residential occupants laid out in the FSI regulations. However, no occupant's allocated carpet area should exceed the basic area plus the additional area. Exceptions may arise from planning constraints that prompt the Municipal Commissioner to grant a slightly larger area. Should extra area be permitted due to planning constraints, it should be deducted from the sale component, ensuring there's no impact on the surplus area.



The regulations establish that eligible residential or residential cum commercial slum dwellers are entitled to a carpet area of 27.88 sq. m (300 sq.ft.). In the case of nonresidential categories, the pre-existing area or 20.90 sq.m, whichever is larger, is granted. The purpose of existing Carpet area/ rehabilitation “carpet area” signifies the net usable floor area within a tenement. This area excludes the space covered by walls and any other spaces specifically exempt from the floor space index computation as per the then-prevailing regulations. In contrast, balcony areas are included if allowed free of FSI according to the prevailing regulations.


# The Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions applicable to Specific Categories with Emphasis on Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



## Subsection 33(9): Regulations for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s)(CDS)



The Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) has specific rules outlining the calculation of the Total Floor Space Index (FSI), which is determined by the gross plot area. However, these calculations exclude features such as reservations, existing amenities, and road setbacks. The total allowable FSI for such development schemes is set at 4.00, also including BUA under reservations, existing amenities, and road setbacks. This value can alternatively be defined by the sum total of the Rehabilitation FSI and Incentive FSI, selecting the greater of these two.



Please note that the FSI mentioned above excludes any Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) as per the guidelines specified under DCR 31(3). 



The Incentive FSI allowed for such schemes is proportional to the Basic Ratio, which is the Land Rate (LR) divided by Rate of Construction (RC), both measured in Rs/sq. m. The lands included in the URC follow either the ASR or READY RECKONER for their valuation. 



**Table-B** offers deeper insights into Incentive FSI values (stated as the percentage of Admissible Rehabilitation Area) based on the Basic Ratio (LR/RC). 



- For clusters above 6.00 LR/RC measuring 0.4 to 1 hectare, the incentive FSI is 85% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- In clusters above 6.00 LR/RC and more than 1 hectare up to 5 hectares, the incentive FSI increases to 90% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For areas above 6.00 LR/RC and more than 5 hectares up to 10 hectares, the incentive FSI is 95% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- When the cluster is above 6.00 LR/RC and more than 10 hectares, the incentive FSI reaches 100% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- Clusters with LR/RC above 4.00 and up to 6.00, measuring 0.4 to 1 hectare, have an incentive FSI of 95% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- Clusters with LR/RC above 4.00 and up to 6.00, for ploat area more than 1 hectare and up to 5 hectares, the incentive FSI is 100% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- Clusters with LR/RC above 4.00 and up to 6.00, and plot area more than 5 hectares up to 10 hectares, the incentive FSI is 105% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- In clusters with LR/RC above 4.00 and up to 6.00, and more than 10 hectares, the incentive FSI increases to 110% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters with LR/RC above 2.00 and up to 4.00, and 0.4 to 1 hectare, the incentive FSI is 105% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters with LR/RC above 2.00 and up to 4.00, for more than 1 hectare and up to 5 hectares, the incentive FSI is 110% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters with LR/RC above 2.00 and up to 4.00, and more than 5 hectares up to 10 hectares, the incentive FSI is 115% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- In clusters with LR/RC above 2.00 and up to 4.00, and more than 10 hectares, the incentive FSI reaches 120% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters up to 2.00 LR/RC, plot size measuring 0.4 to 1 hectare, the incentive FSI is 115% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters up to 2.00 LR/RC, for plot area more than 1 hectare and up to 5 hectares, the incentive FSI is 120% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- For clusters up to 2.00 LR/RC, and more than 5 hectares up to 10 hectares, the incentive FSI is 125% of the admissible rehabilitation area.

- When the cluster is up to 2.00 LR/RC and more than 10 hectares, the incentive FSI reaches 130% of the admissible rehabilitation area.



This table defines the term *RC* as the rate of construction for RCC Construction, and *LR* as the rate of open land for FSI 1.



The processing of applications involving more than one land rate requires a weighted average of all applicable rates for the calculation of the Average Land Rate and the Basic Ratio. 



Additionally, the Basic Ratio calculation must use the Land Rate (LR) and the Rate of Construction (RC) for the year the Cluster Development Project received approval and the Letter of Intent (LOI) issued by the approving authority, with the ratio remaining unchanged throughout the completion process of the scheme even if any revisions or modifications occur.



In case the approved Scheme adds or removes any area and a slab change occurs, the total area of the revised Scheme must recalculate the incentive FSI according to the new slab. Nevertheless, additions to a CDS cannot be less than 75% of the minimum area required for CDS.


##  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permissions for Specific Categories


###  Reconstructing or Redeveloping Building Clusters under Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)



33.1 The augmentation of the Cluster Development's (CD's) area can't be permitted once the Completion Certificate (CC) for more than 75% of the total allowed Built-Up Area (BUA) sanctioned under the original scheme has been issued. 



33.2 There would be no revision in individual areas following the amalgamation of the area. This rule maintains the integrity of the layout and purpose of the original scheme.



33.3 Deletion of a particular region from an approved scheme can only be permitted under certain conditions. Firstly, the construction of the rehabilitation component has not commenced. Secondly, such removal does not interrupt the continuity of the area under the Cluster Development Scheme (CDS). 



These conditions ensure proper planning and structured development under CDS. Different rules apply to differently categorized schemes, solidifying the importance of the scheme's category in influencing its development permissions and restrictions. Proper adherence to these details ensures the effective and functional use of the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


# Detailed Insights on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories and Its Allocation in Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



This document segment elaborates on 'Additional Floor Space Index (FSI)' that can be given permission under certain circumstances. To be specific, it focuses on the scenario of 'Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings' under 'Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)' as outlined in point 33(9). It details how the 'Rehabilitation FSI' and 'Incentive FSI' when totalled, and if found less than 4.00, can have the balance FSI shared between MHADA and Promoter/Developer on a ratio basis. 



In the case of section 33(9) - 'Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings' under 'Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)', if the sum of 'rehabilitation FSI' and 'incentive FSI' is below 4.00, then the remaining FSI over and above the total of these elements upto the limit of 4.00 would be divided in terms of Built-up Area (BUA) between MHADA and the Promoter/Developer. This division is conducted in correspondence with the provisions of Table-C as provided below.



## Details from Table-C about sharing of Balance FSI in CDS under section 33(9)



Below are the specific details from Table-C that explain how the balance FSI is allocated between MHADA and the promoter / developer, when the rehabilitation FSI and incentive FSI total less than 4.00. This shares the balance FSI under the framework of section 33(9) - 'Reconstruction or redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings' under 'Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)'.



- When the 'Basic Ratio (LR / RC)' exceeds 6.00, the 'Promoter/Developer Share' of the FSI balance stands at 30% and 'MHADA Share' holds the majority of 70%.


- When the 'Basic Ratio (LR / RC)' is above 4.00 and upto 6.00, the 'Promoter/Developer Share' increases slightly to 35% with the 'MHADA Share' reducing to 65%.


- For a 'Basic Ratio (LR / RC)' above 2.00 and up to 4.00, the 'Promoter/Developer Share' improves to 40%, while the 'MHADA Share' shrinks further to 60%.


- Lastly, if the 'Basic Ratio (LR / RC)' is up to 2.00, the 'Promoter/Developer Share' manages to reach 45%, and the 'MHADA Share' is at a marginally higher percentage of 55%.


# Section 33: Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provided to Certain Categories


## Subsection 33(9): Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Clusters of Buildings Under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



The tenements coming to MHADA's share can be provided by the Promoter/Developer elsewhere within the same or adjacent Municipal Ward, given MHADA's approval. The calculation will be done according to this formula: the area of tenements allocated to MHADA at location 'B' in the CDS equals the area of tenements assigned to MHADA at location 'A' in the CDS, multiplied by the land rate per ASR/READY RECKONER value of location 'A' divided by the ASR/READY RECKONER value of location 'B'. Location 'A' refers to the initial location for MHADA share allocation, while location 'B' symbolizes the new location for the tenements. 



If entities like MCGM and MMRDA do not require tenements offered by MHADA for PAP's or transit accommodation, then the share received by MHADA shall be used for PAPs or Transit Accommodation or sold for Affordable Housing (AH) under the government's prior consent.



Tolerated structures located nearby and encroaching roads may be incorporated in CDS, with its built-up area (BUA) falling under rehabilitation area, as long as the structures are permanently removed. A tolerated structure is defined as a building used for dwelling or commercial purposes that existed before 17th April 1964 or 1st April 1962, or a date as decided by the government.



The implementation of the sanctioned CDS may occur in phases if the CD area exceeds 8000 sq. m in Island City and 12000 sq. m in Suburbs and Extended Suburbs, consistent with the approved Master Plan/Layout Plan for the entire CDS. Phase-wise CDS implementation may be permitted, assuming the entire cluster's master plan is followed and the FSI is utilized pro rata. 



Before offering phased implementation permission for the CDS, the completion timeframe for each phase will be presented. The minimum area for each phase must be 4000 sq. m in Island City and 6000 sq. m in Suburbs and Extended Suburbs. Further, while granting phased implementation of CDS, the incentive FSI as per Table-B must be released first according to the plot area under a given phase, and the remaining incentive FSI must be released when approving the final phase.





#  Additional Floor Space Index Regulations for Specific Categories 



##  Provisions Affecting Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Building Clusters Under Cluster Development Schemes 



The complete Floor Space Index (FSI) accessible under Clause 6 must be leveraged for the rehabilitation element and MHADA's share on the designated plot or plots under the Cluster Development Scheme (CDS). In the event that a proportion of the incentive FSI isn't anticipated for usage on the very same plot, Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in accordance with Regulation No 32 will be provided. The potential amount of TDR is guided by the succeeding formulation.



The sentence representing the relationship of Incentive FSI at location 'B' in CDS is: Incentive FSI at location 'B' in CDS equals Incentive FSI at location ‘A’ in CDS computed by the ASR or READY RECKONER value of Land at location ‘A’, divided by the ASR or READY RECKONER value of Land at location‘B'.



For clarity, location ‘A’ is identified as the original location where the incentive FSI in CDS is produced. Conversely, location ‘B’ is considered as the novel location where the said incentive FSI is proposed for utilization.


# Detailed Guidelines on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allocations for Specific Categories under Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)



## Guidelines for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Clusters of Buildings under Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)



Reconstruction or redevelopment of slums or buildings that fall under Reservations as per the Development Plan (DP) will be authorized as outlined in Regulation 17(3)(C)(I). The entire Floor Space Index (FSI) admissible under this Regulation for the area of a proposed DP Road or Regular line of street that cuts through the CDS area can be allocated within the same Scheme. 



Regarding DP road or pre-existing roads in the CDS, rearrangement can be done based on a comprehensive traffic study while maintaining the continuity of the existing traffic flow and the total area of the existing road and DP Road. Realignment or relocation of such roads is allowed as per the provisions of the MMC Act. 



Exemption from premium charges applies for the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) allocated as per Regulation 31(3) for the rehabilitation portion of CDS as approved by the High Power Committee (HPC), for the tenements to be turned over to MHADA, and for the areas of reservation handed over to MCGM or the appropriate authority. However, the utilization of the Fungible Area for the Sale Component under the Urban Renewal Scheme (URS) is not permitted.



## Provisions on Utilization of Incentive FSI in Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)



A total of 30% of the incentive FSI can be used for non-residential purposes as otherwise permitted under the DCPR, or 50% with the approval of the Municipal Commissioner.



## Cess Structure for Developments in Cluster Development Schemes (CDS) 



Development cess at the rate of 100% of the Development Charge, subject to a minimum of Rs 5000 per sq. m. for Built-Up Area (BUA) over and above the existing BUA (ignoring Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA)/BUA), for the rehabilitation and free sale component, shall be required for any CDS by the MCGM and in accordance with the timetable for such payment laid down by the Commissioner. 



Note that this development cess does not apply to the BUA handed over to the MCGM or any Public Authority in place of reservation or to the amenity areas handed over to the MCGM as per the requirement indicated by the MCGM or the HPC.



## Arrangements for Temporary Transit Camps in Cluster Development Schemes (CDS)



Temporary transit camps can be allowed within the same Cluster Development (CD) or elsewhere within MCGM boundaries on land owned by the Promoter/Developer up to 4.00 FSI with the concessions permitted under Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) Scheme under Regulation 33(10). Such transit camps must be demolished after a full occupation certificate is granted for the Rehabilitation Component by the Corporation for the redeveloped building. Until these camps are completely demolished, the Commissioner will not release FSI for the free sale area under the CDS beyond 75% of the total admissible Incentive FSI.


# Enhanced Provisions Regarding Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) & Non-conforming Activities



## Various Categories Potentially Allowed More Floor Space Index (FSI)


A category that might be entitled to an additional Floor Space Index (FSI) focuses explicitly on the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of buildings within the framework of Cluster Development Schemes (CDS).



## Permission of Non-Conforming Activities Amidst Redevelopment and Reconstruction


The policy permits the re-accommodation of all existing activities, irrespective of their non-conforming nature. This allowance doesn't extend to activities that are hazardous, highly polluting or those where the Promoter, Developer, or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) must provide alternative accommodation elsewhere.


# Detailed Explainer - Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Reconstructions or Redevelopments under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



33. This regard pertains to granting additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that might be allowed to specific categories.



## Subdivision 33 (9) - Understanding FSI in CDS Reconstructions or Redevelopments:


For reconstructions or redevelopment endeavors of clusters of buildings that fall under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS), the FSI across all intents and purposes will be calculated on the total or gross CDS area. However, certain regulations apply. 



### Restrictions and Exemptions in FSI Calculation:


Areas of common passages measuring not more than 2.00 m in width, provided for giving access to the tenements in rehabilitation component, or the tenements to be handed over to MHADA, and against reservation, will not be counted towards FSI. This bypasses anything ascertained in Regulation No.31(1).



### Open Space Considerations for Rehabilitation Component or Composite Buildings:


For a building under rehabilitation or a composite building with height up to 32.0 m, the front and marginal open spaces should be maintained at 3.0 m and 4.5 m respectively.



As a caveat to this rule, for a building with a height exceeding 32.0 meters and up to 70 meters, there must be at least 6 meters of open space on one side at ground level within the plot that can be accessed from the roadside for a fire engine's maneuverability.



### Regulation Provisions for CD Plot Locations and Open Spaces:


A regulation in place known as Regulation No 41 (Table No. 18) stands to govern if the CD plot location is adjacent to a DP Road of at least 18.3 meters wide. In such cases, the front marginal open space may not need maintenance beyond 3.0 meters, unless the road is identified as an Express Highway or a road wider than 52m.



Additionally, the Front Open Space (FOS) for CDS fronting a 12.00 Mt. wide road would be 4.50 Mt. in the city and suburbs.



### Regulations Concerning CD Plot Locations Near Nallahs:


Suppose a CD plot is located near a trained nallah, the open space along the nallah's margin should be maintained at 6.0 meters from the edge of the nallah.



### Distance and Height Regulations between Rehabilitation Buildings:


There needs to be at least a 6.00m distance maintained between any two rehabilitation buildings with a maximum height of up to 32m. However, if a building constructed under CDS is more than 32.0 m tall, the marginal open space shall follow the guidelines set by Regulation No 41(5). 



### BUA and AOS Provisions:


A composite building (inclusive of all wings) under CDS should dedicate at least 50 percent of Built-up Area (BUA) as the rehabilitation component. Provided more than the minimum front and marginal spaces, such additional areas can be deemed part of an Amenity Open Space (AOS) without being subjected to any premium, as a concession to the stipulation in Regulation No. 27.



### Relaxations in Building Access:


Access to the buildings will typically follow the provisions of Regulation No. 23. However, should design constraints for buildings (up to 32.0 m height) demand relaxation in access width within the CDS, it may be given. Conversely, high-rise buildings are governed by Regulation No.19.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowed under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



## Subtopic: Reconstructing or Redeveloping Clusters of Buildings under 33(9) Regulation of Cluster Development Scheme



In certain cases, the Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) may be decreased to enable the viability of a Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) project, however, it's mandatory to allocate at least 10% of CD plot area for LOS. Rephrasing the complex regulation further, another 10% of CD plot area must be designated for LOS which can be used against DP reservation/land component of built-up amenity to be handed over to MCGM if there exist any on such plot.



If looking at proposals for converting old schemes sanctioned under Regulations 33(7), 33(9) to the modified provision of DCPR 33(9), in cases where more than half the plinth area has been completed, the Commissioner of MCGM may relax the requirement for an additional 10% LOS area.



In circumstances where proposals are aligned with this modified regulation, the Municipal Commissioner has the discretionary power to relax norms for staircase width and open spaces, based on factors such as road width and available open space. This special permission is granted as per Regulation 6(b).



For exemption from staircase and lift well charges, the citizens must fulfill the criteria laid down in Regulation 31(1).



The Municipal Commissioner also has the authority to relax requirements for marginal open spaces, except for the front marginal open space, and parking spaces to make the CDS viable. However, these relaxations should not compromise general health, fire, and safety regulations. The Government retains the power to relax any of the provisions in these Regulations.



The above-mentioned relaxations are relevant only for the rehabilitation component and the composite buildings under the CDS. No premium will be charged for these relaxations or for those specified in Regulation 31(1).



If the Municipal Commissioner grants further relaxation in open spaces, such cases will require compliance with CFO requirements and recovery of premium at the rate of 2.5% of the ASR/READY RECKONER value.



Should any front open space relaxation is approved by the Municipal Commissioner in the sale component, it will be subject to CFO compliance and premium recovery at 2.5% of ASR/READY RECKONER.



In cases where building and other requirements are relaxed for rehabilitation, the stipulations incorporated in sub-Regulation 6 of Regulation 33(10) apply, with the exception of clauses 6.11, 6.16, and 6.18. Payment of premium will be at the rate of 10% of the normal premium or at the rate of 2.5% of land rates as per ASR/READY RECKONER (For FSI (1)), whichever is greater.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permissions for Specific Categories


##  Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Building Clusters under Cluster Development Scheme (CDS)



In the context of rebuilding or redeveloping clusters of buildings within the purview of Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS), there are certain critical points to consider: 



1. The building plans proposed under the CDS must be sanctioned by the Municipal Commissioner in accordance with the Municipal Mercantile Committee (MMC) Act and the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MRTP) Act, 1966. This requirement is applicable even when the CDS includes slums on Municipal/ Government properties existing prior to 1st January, 2000 or any other reference date as disclosed by the Government.



2. Any religious structure on the CDS site prior to the redevelopment that has permission to be redeveloped must conform to the guidelines laid out by the government. Subsequently, the area of such structures should not exceed their previous footprint.



3. Transfer of tenements within CDS is regulated by the Maharashtra Rent Control Act until the formation of a Co-operative Housing Society, following which the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act will apply. However, tenements built specifically for slum rehabilitation are non-transferable for a decade.



4. The promotor or developer of the CDS is mandated to create a Corpus fund of a minimum of Rs 50,000/- per tenement or as directed by the High-Powered Committee (HPC). This fund will be distinctively utilized towards the maintenance of rehabilitation buildings for a period of 10 years.



5. Any ongoing projects under Regulation 33(7) that meet the criteria of this Regulation can be incorporated in the proposal under Regulation 33(9) or can be converted into a CDS in line with Regulation 33(9). However, any dilutions of reservations under Regulation 33(7) should be reinstated accordingly.



6. Heritage buildings of Grade I & II, authorized and structurally sound retainable buildings can be included in the CDS but must remain in their existing state. The Promoter/Developer must pay a Heritage Cess at 5% of the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR) or Ready Reckoner for these structures. The provisions under the Development Control and Promotional Regulations (DCPR) will apply to Grade-III heritage structures and buildings in heritage precincts.



7. If the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) approves areas for amenities like Fire Stations, Hospitals, Police Stations, Schools, Project-Affected People (PAP)/Rehabilitation & Resettlement (R&R), these will be handed over to the concerned authority free of cost. The Built-Up Area (BUA) of such an amenity will be included in the calculation of rehabilitation FSI, and incentive FSI will be permissible under this regulation.


# Section 33 - Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed To Certain Categories


## Subsection 33(9): Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Cluster(s) of Buildings under Cluster Development Scheme(s) (CDS)



Clause 21: The High Power Committee (HPC), overseen by the Municipal Commissioner and established by the Government, holds the authority to approve Cluster Development Schemes (CDS) with the Government's prior agreement under this Regulation. Following HPC endorsement, proposals should be submitted to the Municipal Commissioner, MGC for plan approval. The HPC's decisions are subject to appeal under section 47 of the MR&TP Act, 1966. However, the Government cannot sanction any CDS without thoroughly considering the Impact Assessment study mentioned in clause 1.1.



Clause 22: Independently of its total area, any Cluster Renewal Scheme (CRS) that has been issued a LOI under Regulation 33(9) of DCR 1991 before this Regulation's entry into force is allowed to convert according to this Regulation, upon request of the promoter/developer with prior approval from the State Government. The Basic Ratio for calculations purposes, as defined in Clause 6(b), should consider the land rate (LC) and the rate of construction (RC) from the year the CDS got approved and the LOI was issued by the competent authority. The development surcharge for such a CDS should be calculated based on the date the development cess was paid and should be collected before the issuance of the CC following the Scheme's conversion. If the development cess paid exceeds the amount due, it can be adjusted against other charges, but it would not be refundable. Conversion of any CDS that has not received prior Government approval requires Government endorsement. Land pooling and the creation of buildable reservations and Transit Camps construction in the CDS approved before this Regulation came into effect may be done according to this Regulation's stipulations, even if the CDS has not yet been converted to develop according to this Regulation. 



Clause 23: Any ongoing Cluster Development Scheme (CDS) permitted under Regulation 33(9) of DCR 1991 or DCPR- 2034 before this Regulation came into effect, including partly finished schemes, is acceptable for conversion as per this revised Regulation. Conversion requests must be submitted by the promoter/developer, the high Power Committee must give prior approval, and the provisions of this revamped regulation, including the rehabilitated area, must be adhered to. Notably, such conversions are optional and not obligatory.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) under the Urban Renewal Scheme of Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



The Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) involves the renewal and redevelopment of buildings and chawls, including cessed buildings, located in non-slum areas within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA). These areas are managed by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), which falls under the broader purview of the DRP. The overall FSI for these DRP areas is set at 4.00. The FSI given to a particular plot within these areas will be either 4.00 or the FSI required for the rehabilitation of the current tenants or occupiers, along with an incentive FSI. This is regulated according to specific guidelines.



#  Applicability and Implementation of the Provisions in the DNA



For the comprehensive planning and development of non-slum areas within the DNA through sectoral layouts of the DRP, these regulations will apply. These include the renewal and redevelopment of buildings, chawls, including cessed properties, and other schemes on areas which are considered part of the DRP territory. The DRP, managed by the SRA, utilizes a competitive bidding process implemented by either a developer or a Public Authority. 


The scheme may also adopt different measures as mandated by the Government from time to time. Any properties not part of the DRP Area are subject to development in accordance with DCR 30.



Renewal and redevelopment projects formulated by the SRA for buildings, chawls, and including cessed properties, offers an FSI of 1.72, or the FSI required for rehabilitation of existing eligible occupants. This FSI will be utilized exclusively for rehousing existing eligible occupants and for generating additional tenants or units. The built-up area (BUA) of this construction with 1.72 FSI or more shall be termed as RRC (Rehabilitation and Redevelopment or Rehousing and Renewal Construction?).



#  Key Terms for Already Redeveloped Areas and Private Unencumbered Plot



(a) If areas that were previously redeveloped under SRD/SRA schemes are included in the DRP Zone for further redevelopment, the Transferrable Development Rights (TDR) generated from the plot in the earlier SRD/SRA scheme would be deducted from the overall calculation of the 4.00 FSI.



(b) For private unencumbered plots situated within the DNA which are currently excluded, the FSI would rise to 4.00 on their inclusion in the DRP. However, the developer will have to pay a premium, as set by the DRP, on a BUA equivalent to a 2.67 FSI of that plot. This allows the developer to build up to a BUA equivalent to 4.00 FSI in his free sale component.


# Detailed Regulations for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Eligibility for Renewal Rehab Tenements in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



The Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) is subjected to specific provisions when it comes to construction regulations. The appointed developer for the Dharavi Rehabilitation Project (DRP) is responsible for carrying out the construction of the Residential Renewal Component (RRC) following the planning and requirements set by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



It's notable that each eligible occupant is entitled to be rehabilitated and provided with the carpet area they previously occupied. However, the carpet area is bound by a minimum of 27.88 sq.m (300 sq. ft) and a maximum equal to the one occupied in the old building. RRC will be offered free of cost to residents if the carpet area is up to 70 sq.m, whilst any area above that will require payment for construction cost as set by the OSD, DRP, and SRA. 



The Carpet area or its equivalent refers to the net usable floor area within a building unit, not counting the areas covered by walls or areas specifically excluded from FSI computation following the then/prevailing Regulation. 



As for Non-residential occupants, the area provided will be equivalent to their previous occupation. Notably, the renewed tenements in the finished buildings will be given to the eligible inhabitants of the old building, as confirmed by the Competent Authority and must be free of encumbrances.



To be eligible for Renewal Rehab tenements under the Urban Renewal Scheme(URS), occupants must have been residing in their units since the 1st of January, 2000. Certified inspections extracts from the MCGM for the year 1999-2000 or court orders verifying the existence of tenements pre 2000 will be adequate proof of residency. Meanwhile, unauthorized construction and extensions will not be considered in any calculations.



Also, an area equivalent to 13.33 sq. m of Built Up Area (BUA) as Renewal Sale Component (RSC) will be provided for 10 sq. m of the RRC for sale in the open market. Further, if the FSI required for the rehabilitation of current eligible occupants plus RSC surpasses FSI 4.00 of a certain plot, the surplus will be absorbed in the total FSI of 4.00 in the entire DRP Area.



Non-residential users are permitted in R and C zones in line with Regulation No. 34, which will be applied to Free Sale Components.





# **Specific Rules for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to Certain Categories in a Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) under Regulation 33(9)(A)**



## **The Locations of Rehabilitation and Redevelopment Centers (RRCs)** 



RRCs, within the designated planning sector layout of the DNA, could be relocated to areas not limited to their current plots. In the event of site constraints, they may, with the special permission of OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority - SRA), be situated outside the particular sector layout but remain in the DNA. 



## **Construction and Relocation Process for RRCs**



Once the proposed RRC buildings are established in an approved sector layout, fully equipped with utilities such as water, sewerage, and electricity, the existing occupants, including those in buildings, chawls, and rented properties of the responsible authorities, will be relocated to their respective newly constructed tenements as per allocation finalized by the concerned authorities.



## **Individual Agreement Requirement**



An individual agreement is required and must be drafted jointly between the Land-Owning Authority, Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), or the DRP-appointed developer and the eligible occupant of each tenement/unit. The agreement will be named for the major occupant and spouse for every rebuilt plot structure.



## **Residential Allotment Order**



Residents who are either differently-abled or part of female-headed households will be prioritized in the initial phase of tenement allocation. Then, the remaining tenements will be randomly assigned to other occupants through lot drawing.



## **Regulations for Non-participating Residents**



Eligible occupants, who willingly decide not to participate in the project, are subjected to the mandates of Regulation No.33(9) and the MHADA Act, 1976 provisions.



## **Composition of The Managing Committee**



The Managing Committee of the proposed Co-operative housing society, which will be formed following the allotment of reconstructed tenements, should ensure that women constitute one-third of the total committee membership.



## **Regulations on Transference of Tenement**



Regulations prohibit the sale, lease, assignment, or any form of transfer of tenements acquired under this scheme for a ten-year period, post-allotment or possession. However, transferring to a legal heir is exempted. In case of violation, the tenement will be repossessed by DRP (SRA).



## **Building Permissions for Urban Renewal Development**



Building permissions for the Urban Renewal development are granted following the procedure stipulated in clauses 2.1 to 2.8 of Regulation No.33(10) A.



## **Provision of Temporary Transit Accommodation**



Temporary transit accommodations will be provided within the DNA, excluding D P road/open space reservation, following the procedure outlined under Regulation No.4 of 33(10)(A).



## **Relaxation in Building and Other Requirements for the Urban Renewal Development**



Provisional relaxation in building and other regulations for Urban Renewal development are granted in accordance with clauses 6.1 to 6.17 of Regulation No.33(10)A.



## **Urban Renewal Development and DP Reservations**



Urban Renewal Development and DP Reservations will be governed according to clauses 7.1 to 7.9 of Regulation 33(10)A.


# Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index for Certain Categories


##  33(9)(A): Regulations governing Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



For any project within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA), the responsible land-owning authority is mandated to award Development Rights (DRs) of their land, equivalent to 70% of the net premium payable by the developers, to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) acting as the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP). This arrangement is premised on the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Component (RRC) generated on said land. Should the project be taken up by a Public Authority, the Government decides the premium payable.



Land leasing conditions stipulate that if the land scheduled for RRC construction under DRP is government-owned or falls within MCGM/MHADA/MMRDA/Any Undertaking jurisdiction, it should be leased to the Occupant's Co-operative Housing Society on a renewable 30-year lease, set at a rent regulated by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM). The same conditions also apply to land under the free sale component. However, the land should be leased directly to the Purchasers Society/Association and not through the rehab renewal occupants' society.



Upon project approval, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the land-owning authority must be obtained for property development under this Urban Renewal Scheme. This ruling applies to lands belonging to any department, undertaking, agency of the State Government, including MHADA, or any local government such as the Municipal Corporation. The NOC should ideally be issued within 60 days following project approval communication. If rejected, reasons must be articulated. If not issued within the stipulated period, it is considered implicitly granted.



The developer is required to provide a corpus fund deposit, amounting to RS 40,000 per tenement/unit or as would be stipulated by the Government over time, with the DRP for allocation to the renewal rehab occupants' cooperative housing society. These funds will be utilized for maintenance purposes and the deposit made in accordance with a schedule laid out by the Officer on Special Duty (OSD), DRP (SRA). By the construction completion period, the corpus fund contribution, calculated at RS 40,000 per completed tenement, should be entirely deposited.



The final 25% of the Building Permission for the free sale component will only be issued upon full deposit of the stipulated corpus fund amount with DRP (SRA).


# Detailed Overview of the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



## Regulations Pertaining to Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



A regulation dictates that an additional fee of Rs. 840/- per Sq. mt. must be paid by a developer for the Built-Up Area (BUA) exceeding the Zonal (basic) FSI, specific to the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA). This charge is intended to cover both the rehabilitation and free sale components of the project. 



## Payment Protocol for Additional FSI in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



The additional FSI charge in the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) must be paid to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) as per the timeline specified by the Officer on Special Duty (OSD), DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)). This payment is to be completed without exceeding the construction completion timeline.



## Fund Utilization for Infrastructure Improvement in Dharavi Redevelopment Project Areas



The additional FSI funds collected by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) are designated for infrastructure improvement schemes within Dharavi Redevelopment Project Areas. 



## Authority for Approving Changes to Additional FSI Regulations in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) holds the authority to introduce changes to these regulations, given they have consulted with the concerned authorities and acquired prior government approval.



## Applicability of Greater Mumbai DCR Provisions to Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



All Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) developments will adhere to the provisions of the Development Control Regulations (DCR) for Greater Mumbai and the other relevant sections of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MR & TP) Act, 1966, with the modification that Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and Municipal Commissioner terms being replaced by Slum Rehabilitation Authority and Officer on Special Duty, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)) respectively.


# Detailed Specifications for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotment in Certain Categories



The Additional Floor Space Index (FSI), a crucial feature in urban planning, may be granted under specific conditions to certain categories. This document is aimed at elucidating these special categories and the terms under which extra FSI can be allowed.



- In the context of the reconstruction or redevelopment of Building Development Department (BDD) chawls clusters at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi under Urban Renewal Scheme(s), promulgated under clause 33(9)(B), the FSI could be conditionally increased. 



- For any reconstruction or redevelopment of building clusters under Urban Renewal Scheme(s) carried out in the Island City of Mumbai by the appointed Planning Authority, a FSI of 4.00 may be sanctioned. 



- Alternatively, the FSI required for the rehabilitation of existing tenants or occupiers, as authenticated by a competent authority appointed by the Government for this purpose, may also be considered. 



- Furthermore, Incentive FSI as per the directives of the related Appendix, if it provides a higher value, can be initiated. 



This segment emphasizes details relevant to FSI allocation under specific conditions, entailing Urban Renewal Schemes and redevelopment projects in Mumbai, especially at BDD chawls' clusters.


# 33. Extra Floor Space Index (FSI) Considerations for Certain Categories


## 33(9)(B)- Reconstruction or Redevelopment Guidance for BDD Chawls Clusters under Urban Renewal Schemes



### 1. Definitions and Regulations for the Urban Renewal Scheme (URS) of BDD Chawls


The **Urban Renewal Scheme** (URS) of BDD Chawls is a scheme designed for the redevelopment of clusters of buildings and structures initially built by the Bombay Development Division within the Island City of Mumbai, located at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg and Shivdi. These clusters, otherwise known as **Urban Renewal Clusters or URCs**, are indicated in the Development Plan (DP) with defined boundaries.



**Identification of Urban Renewal Clusters (URCs)** can occur:


- Via the Development Plan (DP) where it presents well-defined Clusters


- Via the Urban Renewal Plan (URP) pertaining to the area, prepared and occasionally updated by the appointed officer of the Planning Authority


- By the Planning Authority, specifically for clusters of BDD Chawls not indicated on the DP and when the URP isn't prepared yet



However, it's important to note that clusters aren't chosen for redevelopment or URS implementation without carrying out an **Impact Assessment Study**. This study examines the impact the URS would have on the city and sector level infrastructure, amenities, traffic, and environment.



**Land under URS** is treated as a single plot for FSI and computation of marginal distances, irrespective of the tenure of the plots within it. In cases where a URS is not bounded by roads, nallas, and railway lines, the boundary of the Cluster may be determined by the Officer appointed by the Planning Authority.



### 2. Composition and Explanation for Urban Renewal Clusters



The **Urban Renewal Cluster** may contain a mix of structures with various characteristics, including but not limited to:



- Cessed buildings in Island City that are subject to the MHAD Act, 1976


- Buildings that are at least 30 years of age and have been acquired by MHADA


- Authorized buildings that are at least 30 years old, built by Bombay Development Division (BDD)



The age of a building is calculated from the date of the occupation certificate or, if such a certificate is not available, from the first recorded date of property tax assessment. The `age calculation` is as on the 1st of January of the year in which the redevelopment proposal for the URC, complete in all respects, is presented to the Officer appointed by the Planning Authority.



Moreover, buildings and lands associated with the State Government, the Central Government, any semi-Government Organization, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), and the MHADA are also part of these Clusters. This inclusion applies to both developed and vacant lands within the area proposed for the Urban Renewal Scheme, including those given on lease or granted on the tenure of Occupant Class II.





# Detailed Overview of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowances for Specific Categories



This document provides important regulations about the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) which may be permitted for certain categories.



## Rules Governing the Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Certain BDD Chawls' Clusters



Under section 33(9)(B), it is stipulated that the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of Bombay Development Department (BDD) chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi can be executed under various Urban Renewal Schemes. 



## Specifying the Involvement of Government and Semi-Government Organizations



It is further clarified that for buildings or lands owned by the Central Government, the State Government, Semi-Government Organizations, and Mumbai City Government (MCGM) or Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA), the consent from the relative department must be procured before these properties can be included in any Urban Renewal Scheme proposals.



## Criteria for the Inclusion of Structures in Urban Renewal Schemes



Buildings that have fallen into disrepair or reveal structural/sanitary defects, making them unfit for human habitation, or those with bad configurations or located on narrow streets that pose a danger to the health or safety of the area's residents, can be included in Urban Renewal Schemes. This condition is subject to certification by the Officer or the Agency designated for this purpose by Planning Authority.



## Consideration of Dwelling Structures Based on the Maharashtra Slums Area Act, 1971



All dwelling structures, as defined in Section 3 X of Maharashtra Slums Area (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, existing prior to January 1, 2000, are also considered under these guidelines.



## Note on Previously Developed or Developing Areas Under Different DCPR Provisions



There is a caveat on previously developed areas or those areas which are in the process of development under different provisions of the Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR). While these areas can be included in the urban renewal cluster for planning purposes, they should be disregarded when calculating FSI under this Regulation. The admissible FSI should be estimated based on the relevant clauses of the DCPR under which such areas are being developed or have been developed.


#  Provision of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories with Emphasis on Urban Renewal Scheme-Based Reconstruction of BDD Chawls 



###  Stringent Regulations Governing the Inclusion of New Tenancies and Unauthorized Construction in Lieu of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI)



1. The reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of BDD chawls situated at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi falls under certain Urban Renewal Scheme(s) as per clause 33(9)(B) in the governing document.



2. The governance does not consider any newly introduced tenancy created post 13th of June in the year 1996 regarding the calculation of the existing Floor Space Index (FSI). 



3. Unauthorized constructions in existing buildings meant for introducing new tenants into the existing tenancies will not be regarded during the computation of the current FSI. 



4. In order to validate the count of tenements and tenants/occupants within these tenements, necessary proof lies in the certified inspection extract from the Competent Authority/MCGM prior to the 13th of June,1966 and a certification by the Competent Authority appointed by the Government. This was conclusively decided by the GR on 30th of March, 2016. 



5. Nevertheless, for the accurate determination of the eligibility of occupiers and tenants, The Housing Department of the Government holds the right to issue comprehensive guidelines if deemed required. 



6. For the purpose of validation, the list of all eligible tenants and the area possessed by each of them in BDD Chawls should be certified by the Competent Authority appointed by the Government.


# Detailed Overview of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permission for Certain Categories 



The document segment pertains to the provision of additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for particular categories, specifying applicability to the reconstruction or redevelopment of Clusters of BDD chawls located at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi under Urban Renewal Scheme(s). 



### Relevant Definitions and Participant Eligibility



This segment delivers important definitions and eligibility criteria. Notably: 



- Dwelling Structures—as per the document, refers to all dwelling structures as defined in Section 3 X of the Maharashtra Slums Area (Improvement, Clearance, and Redevelopment) Act of 1971. These are structures which existed before January 1, 2000.


- The participant's eligibility for the FSI projection would be certified by Competent Authorities appointed by the government. This facet aligns with the topic's main theory.


- The documentation posits that the eligibility of such occupiers, including transferees under this project, shall be established in compliance with Chapter 1-B of the Maharashtra Slum Area (Improvement, Clearance, and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, and orders issued within its purview. This detail provides essential contextual information directly related to the additional FSI provision for certain categories.


# Detailed Overview on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Categories and Entitlements



The document hones in on the distinct categories in relation to Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowances. This attention is principally centered around item 33, specifically focusing on subpoint 33(9)(B), which concerns the reconstruction or redevelopment of BDD chawls that are located in Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi as part of Urban Renewal Scheme(s). 



In this context, the document stipulates that every certified residential tenant or occupant within these areas will be rehabilitated. Furthermore, they will be handed ownership of a tenement with a carpet area equating to 46.45 square meters. It is important to emphasise that this entitlement covers the rehabilitative area as a consolidated whole. Consequently, no additional compensatory or supplementary FSI will be provided.



Further outlined within the document, it is detailed that eligible religious structures, eligible on-site amenities, and any other non-residential structures identified as eligible, will be accorded an existing carpet area or be subjected to a carpet area as decreed by the government.



As for residents considered to be eligible slum dwellers within these areas, it is stated that they will be entitled to a tenement, the carpet area of which would measure 25 square meters (or rather, 269 square feet). This information forms part of the document's exhaustive examination into Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) categories and entitlements.


# Detailed Analysis on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed for Urban Renewal Schemes Under Certain Regulations in Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi



## Understanding the Rules for Additional FSI in Urban Renewal Schemes



The Urban Renewal Schemes allow for an increased Floor Space Index (FSI) in the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of BDD chawls located at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi. The total permissible FSI for operations under this scheme can reach up to 4.00 gross plot area. This figure takes into consideration area under existing Municipal Roads, built-up area under reservation/designation, Road set-back, or a combination of the Rehabilitation FSI and Incentive FSI, depending on which variable provides the higher value. Exemption is granted to FSI from reservations or designations, Road set-back, and Fungible FSI as stated under DCPR 31 (3). In areas governed by the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ), the FSI rules will be influenced by the MOEF Notifications released intermittently.



The calculated Incentive FSI that goes against the rehabilitation-required FSI is determined by a specific ratio, known as the Basic Ratio. This ratio is the Land Rate (LR) divided by the Rate of Construction (RC), both measured in Rs/sq. m. The variables for this ratio include the lands within the Urban Renewal Cluster, and the rates applicable to the area according to the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR/READY RECKONER).



## FSI Incentive Breakdown Based on Basic Ratio for Urban Renewal Schemes


The structured breakout of incentives based on the Basic Ratio (LR/RC) for the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of BDD chawls under Urban Renewal Schemes at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi is represented as follows:



- For an Urban Renewal Scheme with a Basic Ratio above 6.00, the incentive will be 55% for 0.4ha to 1.0 ha, 60% for 1.0 ha to 5.0 ha, 65% for 5.0 ha to 10.0ha, and 70% for 10ha and above areas, as a percentage of the admissible rehabilitation area.


- Where the Basic Ratio ranges from above 4.00 and up to 6.00, the incentive will increase to 65% for 0.4ha to 1.0 ha, 70% for 1.0 ha to 5.0 ha, 75% for 5.0 ha to 10.0ha, and 80% for 10ha and above areas, as a percentage of the admissible rehabilitation area.


- A Basic Ratio ranging from above 2.00 and up to 4.00 will yield an incentive of 75% for 0.4ha to 1.0 ha, 80% for 1.0 ha to 5.0 ha, 85% for 5.0 ha to 10.0ha, and 90% for 10ha and above areas, as a percentage of the Admissible Rehabilitation Area.


- Lastly, a Basic Ratio up to 2.00 gives an incentive of 85% for 0.4ha to 1.0 ha, 90% for 1.0 ha to 5.0 ha, 95% for 5.0 ha to 10.0ha, and 100% for 10ha and above areas, as a percentage of the admissible rehabilitation area.



## Considerations for Basic Ratio Calculation


RC is determined by the construction rate for R.C.C construction, as provided by the Chief Controlling Revenue Authority & Inspector General of Registration, Maharashtra State from their Annual Statement of Rates. If multiple land rates are applicable to different parts of the plot under the Urban Renewal Scheme, a weighted average of these rates will be used to calculate the Average Land Rate and Basic Ratio. When calculating the Basic Ratio, the Land Rate (LR) and the Rate of Construction (RC) are taken the year the Cluster Development Project was approved by the authorized authority. This ratio remains unaltered, even if the Scheme undergoes subsequent revision or modification during the project's completion phase.


# Allowance of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Specific Categories Under Urban Renewal Scheme



## Reconstructing and Redevelopment of BDD Chawls under Urban Renewal Scheme



In accordance with sub-section 33(9)(B), sanctioned reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of BDD chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi is permissible under the Urban Renewal Scheme(s). 



Encroaching 'tolerated structures' found on the roads in the nearby vicinity could be incorporated into the Urban Renewal Scheme. These structures' built-up area (BUA) would qualify to be included in the rehabilitation area, given their permanent removal. 



Please note, a tolerated structure is defined specifically as any residential or non-residential structure existing prior to April 17th, 1964 or April 1st, 1962 respectively. 



It's permissible for implementing the approved Urban Renewal Scheme in a phased manner. It’s crucial that each phase’s development strictly adheres to the approved Master Plan/Layout Plan for the entire Urban Renewal Scheme. 



Granting permission for the phased implementation of the Urban Renewal Scheme presupposes adherence to the master plan for the entire cluster. Pro rata utilization of the total admissible FSI for rehab and incentive components is allowed for phase-wise implementation of the Urban Renewal Scheme. 



When permitting the phased implementation of the Urban Renewal Scheme, the timeframe for each phase's implementation is also provided. The Planning Authority decides the minimum area for each phase.



## Development of DP Reservations 



As per Regulation No17(3)(C)(II), construction or reconstruction of slums/buildings that fall under reservations as contemplated in the Development Plan is permissible.



## Incentive FSI Usage 



It is allowed to use 30% of the Incentive FSI, designated for non-residential purposes, as otherwise permissible under the DCPR. 



## Imposing Development Cess 



A development cess at the rate of 100% of the Development charge, with a minimum of Rs 5000 per sq. m for BUA over and above the Zonal (basic) FSI, is applicable for the rehabilitation and incentive sale component. Levied by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), this tax has to be paid according to a timetable laid down by the Commissioner of MCGM. This fund is kept in a separate account and is used exclusively for improving the off-site infrastructure around the urban renewal cluster. The development cess is in addition to development charges levied as per section 124 of MR&TP Act 1966. 



However, this surcharge does not apply to the BUA assigned to the MCGM or any Public Authority in lieu of reservation, or to the amenity areas given to the MCGM, as required by the MCGM or the Empowered Power Committee.


# Detailed Explanation on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted to Certain Categories under Urban Renewal Scheme(s)



## Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Specific BDD Chawls Under Urban Renewal Scheme(s)


Under the regulation 33(9)(B), the reconstruction or redevelopment of clusters of BDD chawls located in Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi is to be done under the Urban Renewal Scheme(s).



## Provision for Temporary Transit Camps


In the context of the same Urban Renewal Cluster, or at any location within the MCGM limits on land that is under the ownership of the Planning Authority, temporary transit camps can be allowed up to a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 4.00.  This provision includes conveniences permissible under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) Scheme, as per regulation 33(10) of these Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR). One caveat to consider is that these transit camps must be razed once the full occupation certificate for the Rehabilitation Component of the reconstructed building is granted by an officer appointed by the Planning Authority. The grant of FSI for the Incentive Component area under the Urban Renewal Scheme(s) in excess of 75% of the total admissible Incentive FSI won't be authorized by the officer assigned by the Planning Authority until the total demolition of the transit camps.



## Special Considerations for Designations/Reservations in Development Plan


In the event of specific designations or reservations included in the Development Plan, the officer appointed by the Planning Authority can relocate or interchange the designation or reservation to any other location within the same cluster. This can be done under the condition that access from peripheral or outer road is available or provided, and the area designated or reserved is not under any encumbrances. The shifting or interchanging of designations or reservations should not lead to a reduction in its area, as per established regulations.



## Treatment of Non-Conforming Activities


Non-conforming activities, which include all existing activities, will be allowed to be re-accommodated regardless of their nonconforming nature. This allowance excludes activities that are hazardous, highly polluting or those which require the provision of alternative accommodation elsewhere by the Planning Authority. These exceptional activities will be treated differently according to the guidelines provided by the Planning Authority.


# Detailed Explanation and Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Granted to Certain Categories within Urban Renewal Schemes, Particularly Applicable for Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Clusters of BDD Chawls



## Specific Regulations Pertaining to Reconstruction or Redevelopment of BDD Chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi under Urban Renewal Scheme(s) (URS)



In the context of Urban Renewal Scheme(s) focusing on the reconstruction or redevelopment of Clusters of BDD chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi, tenements set for rehabilitation with a carpet area of 46.45 square meters or those to be delivered to the Planning Authority come under certain regulations.



1. For FSI computations, the gross area of the URS is utilized. This method doesn't opportune recreation open spaces deductions. However, this fact doesn't mitigate the requirement of a physical recreational open space that should be established within the site as per current Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR).



2. The distribution in Regulation 37(20) concerning balconies is carried over to the URS with specific requirements. A balcony should not decrease the marginal open space to under 3.00 meters. Nonetheless, a minimum clear margin of 4.5 meters is mandated at the ground level.



3. Despite the stipulations in Regulation 31(3) of DCPR, common passage areas not exceeding 2.0 meters in width, furnished to access rehabilitated tenements and tenements designated for Planning Authority, are not included in the FSI calculation.



4. For buildings reaching 32.0 meters in height, either in the rehabilitation segment or forming a composite structure, a 4.5-meter allowance is made for open frontal and marginal spaces.



5. A requirement is validated for at least one open space of 6 meters width, accessible from roadside within the plot. This space caters to the maneuverability of emergency vehicles such as fire engines, in cases where the building does not front two roads of a minimum width of 6 meters or lacks an alternate 6-meter access point aside from the adjoining road.



6. Wherever the URC plot faces a DP Road of width 18.3 meters and beyond, the front marginal open space does not need to extend past 4.5 meters, unless the said road is an Express Highway or broader than 52 meters, notwithstanding the provisions specified in Regulation 41 (Table 18).



7. In the event of the URC plot side-lining a trained nallah, the marginal open space along the nallah must measure a minimum of 6.0 meters distanced from the trained nallah's boundary, or the requirement set by the SWD Department of MCGM, whichever predominates.



8. The gap between any two rehabilitated buildings should not drop under 6.00 meters.



9. Where a structure erected under URS measures over 32 meters in height, it should maintain a marginal open space of 6 meters or the requisite imposed by CFO, with the larger deciding the allowance.



10. Additional area allowances beyond mandated front and marginal spaces may, where needed, be assimilated as part of the amenity open space within the URS, inclusive of rehabilitation and incentive FSI components, minus levied premiums, thereby relaxing the regulation stated in Regulation No.27.



## Pathways and Means of Access: Prescribed Ratios



The proportion between the extent of the pathway and its width should adhere to the following guidelines:



###### <!-- The upcoming table outlines the prescribed length and breadth ratios for pathways and means of access within the reconstruction or redevelopment of Clusters of BDD chawls at Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi within Urban Renewal Scheme(s) -->


# Detailed Explanation of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Urban Renewal Scheme(s) (URS) Involving Reconstruction or Redevelopment of Clusters of BDD Chawls



## Guidelines for Pathways and Building Widths in the Urban Renewal Scheme



The Length and Width of the Urban Renewal Scheme are categorized as follow:



- For an URS with length up to 20m, a width of 1.5m is allowed.


- For an URS with length between 21 to 30m, a width of 2.0m is permitted.


- An URS with length from 31 to 40m can have a width of 2.5m.


- An URS measuring between 41 to 59m is permitted to have a width of 3.0m.



If there is a discrepancy between the dimensions prescribed for the pathway and the marginal distances, the larger of the two should be chosen. These pathways should act as access points wherever necessary and the building should be allowed to touch these pathways.



## Accessibility and High-rise Buildings in the Urban Renewal Scheme



The means of access shall be primarily dictated by the provisions of Regulation No. 23. However, possible relaxation in the access width may be granted for buildings up to 32m height in the URS. Nonetheless, high-rise buildings should only be permitted on accesses with widths of 9m or above.



## Open Space and Amenities in the Urban Renewal Scheme



Even if the recreational open space is reduced for URS viability, at least 10% of the URC plot area should be allocated for this purpose. Additionally, 10% of the URC plot area should be marked for amenity space, which can be adjusted against the D.P. reservation, if needed. Any amenity on such a plot is decided by an Officer appointed by the Planning Authority and is to be transferred to the Planning Authority free of charge. 



## Relaxations and Premiums in the Urban Renewal Scheme



For the URS viability, the planning authority officer may sanction any relaxation in marginal open spaces, excluding front marginal spaces, and parking requirements if needed. All the relaxations mentioned above are admissible to the entire project area, and no premiums will be charged for them or for any other relaxations mentioned in Regulation No 31(1).



## Parking and Approvals in the Urban Renewal Scheme



The parking provision in the scheme will be as per Regulation No. 44. The approving/sanctioning authority for the building plans under the URS is the Officer appointed by the Planning Authority as per the MRTP Act, 1966.



## Conditions for Redeveloping Religious Structures in the Urban Renewal Scheme



Existing religious structures on the URS site will be allowed to be redeveloped following governmental guidelines, provided their post-development area does not exceed their pre-development footprint.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions and Regulations



##  Policies Allowance for Reconstruction Under Urban Renewal Scheme



Allowance on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) can be notably granted for the reconstruction or redevelopment of Clusters of BDD chawls at locations including Naigaon, Worli, N.M.Joshi Marg, and Shivdi. These initiatives fall under the Urban Renewal Scheme(s) as stipulated in provision 33(9)(B).



##  Terms Governing the Transfer of Tenements 



Transfers of tenements will initially be subject to regulations outlined in the Maharashtra Rent Control Act. However, once a Co-op. Housing Society is established, these transfers will transition to being overseen by the provisions of the Maharashtra Co-op. Societies Act. Importantly, tenements constructed explicitly for slum rehabilitation are not eligible for transfer for a period of 10 years. The government will determine the transfer fee and period for tenants and other beneficiaries.



##  Establishment and Utilization of Corpus Fund 



By direction of the Empowered Committee, the Planning Authority will form a Corpus Fund. This fund's purpose will be to maintain rehabilitation buildings for a term of 10 years.



##  Amenity Approval and Allocation under Empowered Committee 



If the Empowered Committee, as per Government GR dated 30/03/2016, approves areas for amenities such as Fire Stations, Hospitals, Police Stations, Schools, these amenities, not part of the Development Plan reservations/designations, will be handed to the Planning Authority without charge. The Built-up Area (BUA) of these amenities will be calculated towards the rehabilitation FSI, and Incentive FSI as admissible under this Regulation will be permissible.



##  Approval Process of Schematic Plans of Urban Renewal Schemes



The Empowered Committee will acquire the power to approve the schematic plans of Urban Renewal Schemes under this Regulation upon recommendation by the Planning Authority, as constituted vide GR dated 30/03/2016. After approval by the Empowered Committee, the Officer appointed by the Planning Authority will sanction the final plans of Urban Renewal Schemes (URS). However, the Empowered Committee will not sanction any Urban Renewal Scheme without due regard to the Impact Assessment study referred to in clause 1.1 of this Appendix.


# 33(10)-  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Granted for Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



## Understanding the Eligibility for Redevelopment under the SRA Scheme



In the context of additional Floor Space Index (FSI), a person considered eligible for a redevelopment scheme is referred to as a 'protected occupier' as defined in Chapter IB of the Maharashtra Slums Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, which is subject to amendments over time. This piece of legislature is also commonly referred to as the Slum Act, along with its subsequent orders.



## Eligibility Clause for Actual Occupants in the Redevelopment Scheme



As per these provisions, eligibility for the redevelopment scheme is restricted only to the actual occupants of the hutment. This strictly excludes structure owners who are not the actual occupants, regardless of whether their name is listed in the electoral roll for the structure. In essence, these so-called structure owners hold no rights to the rebuilt tenement corresponding to their previous structure.


# Enhanced Definitions within the Context of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allocated for Slum Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme)



This document refers to the extra Floor Space Index (FSI) which may be granted to particular categories in the context of Slum Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme). The terms mentioned in this section such as 'slums', 'Slum Rehabilitation Area (SRA)', 'composite building' and 'censused' derive their meanings from their usage in the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA Scheme).



According to this scheme, the term 'slum' is defined as an area that has been officially recognized and proclaimed as such under the Slum Act, either in the past or the future. A 'slum' could also be an area or stretch of pavement that is consequently designated or considered a Slum Rehabilitation Area.



An 'Slum Rehabilitation Area' includes any location identified as such by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), primarily those satisfying the conditions of section 4 of the Slum Act. To be classified as a 'slum area', the area must fulfill specific criteria and/or be needed for the execution of a slum rehabilitation project. An area becomes a designated slum rehabilitation zone if a project under the SRA scheme has received approval from the CEO of the SRA.



An area purposed or planned for the construction of temporary or permanent transit camps, and sanctioned by the SRA can also be considered a Slum Rehabilitation Area. In these areas, any projects approved by the SRA are regarded as Slum Rehabilitation Projects.



The term 'pavement' in this document is understood as any Municipal, Government, or Semi-Government pavement, including any viable stretch of pavement seen as potentially useful for the SRA Scheme.



In this context, a 'structure' signifies the total residential area of a protected occupier as described in Chapter I-B of the Slums Act, along with any orders issued under it.



The term 'composite building' refers to a structure consisting of both rehabilitation and free-sale components, or a portion thereof, within the same building.



Finally, the term 'censused' refers to the process where slums located on lands owned by the Government, a governmental agency, or the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) are officially recorded by the land-owning authority as having been censused either in 1976, 1980, 1985, prior to 1st January 1995, or 1st January 2000.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Specific Categories:



## 33(10)- Rules for Additional FSI under Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



- Under the SRA Scheme for rehabilitation of slum dwellers, the reconstructed tenement is designated as joint ownership between the hutment dweller and their spouse. 



- Such ownership status under the SRA Scheme is officially recorded in the cooperative housing society's records.



- This includes joint ownership status on share certificates and all other pertinent documents related to the reconstructed tenement under the rehabilitation of slum dwellers initiative. 



- By these regulations, the joint ownership status between the slum dweller and spouse is established and deemed recorded in the cooperative housing society's records.


# 33. Specification of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitting Alterations for Specific Categories



## 33(10): The Implication of the Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers on Additional Floor Space Index (SRA Scheme)



The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) holds the prerogative to denotify the Slum Rehabilitation Area. This action is undertaken either as a necessity deemed by the SRA or following directives issued by the State Government, and has implications on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


# Detailed Insight on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Certain Categories


## Emphasis on Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



Here is a clarification on the provisions applicable for the redevelopment or construction of accommodation for hutment or pavement-dwellers. The engagement in this engagement can incorporate owners, developers, or co-operative housing societies of the hutment or pavement-dwellers. It can also be via public authorities like MHADA, MIDC, MMRDA, and so forth. Also, it can include the input of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) operating within the limits of MCGM. 



However, a key criterion for NGOs is that they must be registered under the Maharashtra Public Charitable Trusts Act, 1961, and the Societies Registration Act, 1960 for at least the last five years. Furthermore, their standing must be approved by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).


# Detailed Explanation on the Provisions for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in Certain Categories and the Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers



## 33.1 Provisions for Hutment-dwellers in the SRA Scheme


The Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) provisions state that eligible hutment-dwellers, either in the slums or on the pavement, will be given a free residential tenement with a carpet area of 27.88 sq. m, including provisions like balcony, bath, and water closet, but excluding communal areas. The given term carpet area here indicates the usable floor area within a dwelling, which excludes any area covered by walls or other areas exempt from FSI computation as per the current regulations.



## 33.2 Carpet Area Specifications in the SRA Scheme


Under the SRA Scheme, protected dwellings having residential areas more than 27.88 sq. m will also be entitled only to the 27.88 sq. m of carpet area. Here, the carpet area includes the area of tenements exclusive of all areas under walls and partition walls, if any.



## 33.3 Rehabilitation Terms for Eligible Hutment Dwellers


All eligible hutment dwellers involved in the SRS are to be rehabilitated according to these regulations and as much as possible, this may occur within the current scheme and location.



## 33.4 Regulations on Rehabilitation Location for Certain Dwellers


Pavement dwellers and slum dwellers on land needed for important public purposes, or locations unsuitable for human habitation or non-suitable due to legal restrictions, will not be rehabilitated in-situ but in alternative locations, according to these regulations. The eligibility of these dwellers will be decided after a verification of documents by a Competent Authority appointed by the State Government in the Housing Department.



## 33.5 Eligibility Criteria for Individuals under the SRA Scheme


The eligibility of an individual, including a transferee, involved in a Slum redevelopment scheme, will be established as per Chapter I B of the Slum Act and the subsequent orders issued under it.



## 33.6 Specific Agreement Conditions for Hutment Dwellers


For the rehabilitation process, there needs to be an individual agreement in place between the owner/ developer/ co-operative housing society/ NGO and the eligible slum/pavement dweller.



## 33.7 Joint Agreement Provisions Under the SRA Scheme


The agreement made between a hutment-dweller and the owner/developer/co-operative society/ NGO needs to be in joint names of the primary hutment dweller and the spouse for every protected dwelling structure.



## 33.8 Priority in Allotment for Certain Dwellers under SRA Scheme


The differently-abled individuals or female-headed households within the dweller category are given first priority in the allotment of tenements. Once their allotment is complete, the remaining tenements will be allotted to other eligible dwellers.



## 33.9 Transfer of Photopasses Provisions 


Post redevelopment, a photopass will be provided only to the current occupant since they are the only ones eligible for redevelopment. This eliminates the need for regularising transfers of photopasses that have taken place so far.



## 33.10 Eligibility Restrictions under the SRA Scheme


Any individual owning a dwelling unit on an ownership basis within the MCGM area will not be considered eligible under this scheme. Further, anyone potentially eligible under more than one SRS scheme will be held eligible in only one.





#  Revised Guidelines for Increasing Floor Space Index in Certain Categories


##  Detailed Provisions for the Redevelopment and Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers Under the SRA Scheme



1. The government, MCGM, MHADA owned land where the Rehabilitation part of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS) will be built, will be leased to the Cooperative Housing Society of the slum dwellers for 30 years initially. The annual lease rent will be Rs. 1001 for 4000 sq.m of land or part thereof. The lease will be renewable for a further 30 years at a time while simultaneously, the land under the free sales component will be leased directly to the Society/Association of the buyers.



2. Pending the establishment of the Society/Association for the purchasers in the free sale component, the lease may be renewed for additional 30-year terms. The lease rent for the free sales component will be determined by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. Further, developers or cooperative housing societies will have to pay a premium equal to 25% of the ASR/Ready Reckoner for the year of issue of the Letter of Intent in the context of SRS.



3. The premium to be paid for lands owned by the government, semi-government departments, and local bodies will go to the respective land-owning authority, such as MHADA, MCGM, MMRDA, within 30 days from the date of recovery.



4. In the case of government-owned land, the premium should be deposited in the Nivara Nidhi, an account set up for the said purpose. All premiums will be recovered in installments as directed by the government and land-owning bodies are prohibited from charging premiums in other forms.



5. No Slum Rehabilitation Scheme proposals on land owned by the Central Government will be accepted unless a No Objection Certificate for the scheme is obtained from the Central Government first.



6. In cases where land is under a vacant land tenure that is created by MCGM or Municipal Commissioner, such tenure will be terminated automatically upon the issue of intent for a Slum Rehabilitation Scheme by the SRA. Moreover, any arrears or dues collected by the MCGM will not be tied to the issuance of any certificates or NOCs for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme.



7. Upon the sanction of a Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, the rights of tenants will be terminated with respect to the sanctioned SRS.



8. Any outstanding dues such as assessment, compensation, occupational charges, non-agricultural tax/dues, etc. that are pending with public authorities such as the State Govt, MHADA, and/or MCGM will be dealt with separately and will not be linked to the granting of approval or the issuance of building permission for slum rehabilitation projects.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Potential for Certain Categories: A Focus on Slum Rehabilitation Projects (SRA Scheme)



###  Criteria and Considerations for Slum Rehabilitation Projects under FSI



- Slum Rehabilitation Projects are highly encouraged when proposed by a registered co-operative housing society of onsite hutment dwellers. All eligible dwellers should be included in the submission of the Slum Rehabilitation scheme, and an undertaking should be given to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



- Where 51 percent or more eligible hutment-dwellers in a slum agree to join a rehabilitation scheme, the scheme may be considered for approval. This is subject to the submission of written agreements before issuing an Letter of Intent (LOI).



- This stipulation does not apply to Slum Rehabilitation Projects initiated by the State Government, public authority or a Government Company defined in Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956.



### Provisions for Onsite Hutment-Dwellers Unwilling to Join the Project



- Provisions should be made in the rehabilitation schema for all dwellers who do not willingly join the slum rehabilitation project. 



- Details of the tenement to become available for these dwellers will be communicated to them in writing. Should disputes arise, CEO/Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) has the final say.



- If they opt not to join the scheme within 15 days of project approval, their hutments may be removed under relevant provisions including sections 33, 33(A) and 38 of the Slum Act. 



- They may forfeit their eligibility to certain benefits like transit tenements and reconstructed tenements on initiation of the aforementioned actions.



- Failure to join before building permissions are granted results in forfeiture of rights to any built-up tenements, which are claimed by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) for accommodating other pavement-dwellers and slum dwellers. 



### Governance Aspects in SRA Schemes



- The Managing Committee of proposed, as well as registered co-operative housing societies, plays a crucial role in slum rehabilitation projects under the FSI regulations.


#  Additional Permissions and Regulations for Implementing Floor Space Index (FSI) in Specific Categories



##  Guidelines and Restrictions for Redevelopment Aimed at Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under the SRA Scheme



In the context of the SRA scheme for the rehabilitation of slum dwellers, it is imperative that a cooperative housing society comprised of hutment dwellers maintains a proportion of at least a third of total strength of actual members being women at all times on the committee.



Considered in the perspective of the SRA scheme, the transfer of tenements is subjected to certain restrictions. The tenement obtained under this scheme cannot be sold, leased, assigned, or transferred in any manner except to a legal heir, for a duration of ten years from the date of its allotment or possession. In instances of violation of these terms, with the exception of transfer to a legal heir, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) will regain control and ownership of the tenement.


# Section 33: Policies for Allowing Additional Floor Space Index for Specific Categories


## Subsection 33(10): Rules and Procedures for Redevelopment under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA Scheme)



1. The Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) requires submission of each Slum Rehabilitation Project proposal paired with all the necessary documents, no-objection certificates, and relevant plans.



2. The SRA is mandated to give approval for the Slum Rehabilitation Project within 60 days from the date of submission of all needed documents, provided that the proposed project aligns with the specified regulations.



3. In the approval process, the SRA has the power to stipulate necessary terms and conditions.



4. For providing building permissions for any Slum Rehabilitation Project, the SRA shall adhere to the procedure laid down in the MR&TP Act, 1966.



5. On meeting the set conditions, building permission, in line with section 45 of the MR & TP Act, 1966, will be granted to the Project under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS), initially to the Rehabilitation component and then to the free-sale component.



6. A correlation between the Rehabilitation and free-sale components exists in building permission: 10% of both components may be granted simultaneously and further permissions may be granted proportionately or as decided by the CEO, Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



7. For projects managed directly by an NGO approved by the SRA, the CEO may sanction 20% of the free-sale component without waiting for any expenditure on the rehabilitation component, but the remaining free-sale component will be approved only after completing at least 30% of the rehabilitation component on-site.



8. Upon the Project's approval, the NOC for building permission of the land-owning authority will be provided for that slum located on lands belonging to any State Government department, undertaking, agency, including MHADA, or any local self-government like the MCGM, within 60 days.



9. The Occupation certificate in all slum rehabilitation projects on lands belonging to any department, undertaking, agency of the State Government, including MHADA, and any local self-Government such as the MCGM, will not be delayed solely due to the want of lease documents execution.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Possibilities for Specific Categories and their Impact on 33(10)- Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



## Understanding the FSI Changes for Slum Rehabilitation



The Floor Space Index (FSI) for rehabilitation of eligible slum and pavement dwellers encompass both the FSI intended for the rehabilitation and the free-sale component with a pre-defined ratio.



The Built-Up Area (BUA) designated for rehabilitation involves the overall construction scope excluding those outlined in 31(1) of D.C. Regulations. The aforementioned span includes multiple facilities such as community halls, health centers, skill development centers, and various other social infrastructures compliant with Government Home Department Resolutions on 05/05/2011 and 18/11/2015.



The incentive BUA is contingent upon the scheme's size, developed land rate, and construction rate following the ASR/READY RECKONER of the year the Letter of Intent (LOI) receives approval.



### Incentive BUA/Incentive on Rehab Area to Obtain Sale Area Based on Basic Ratio (LR/RC) and Plot Size



- For any basic ratio (LR/RC) above 6.00 for a scheme area/plot area up to 0.40 ha, the incentive is 0.8. If the area falls within the range 0.4 ha up to 1 ha, the incentive available is 0.85. For schemes with plot area above 1 ha up to 5 ha, the incentive increases to 0.90. If the area falls within the range 5 ha up to 10 ha, the incentive available is 0.95. For schemes with plot area above 10 ha up to 20 ha, the incentive increases to 1.0 and if the plot area is greater than 20 ha, the incentive available is 1.05

- For any basic ratio (LR/RC) exceeding 4.00 and up to 6.00, for a scheme area/plot area up to 0.40 ha, the incentive is 0.90. If the area falls within the range 0.4 ha up to 1 ha, the incentive available is 0.95. For schemes with plot area above 1 ha up to 5 ha, the incentive increases to 1.0. If the area falls within the range 5 ha up to 10 ha, the incentive available is 1.05. For schemes with plot area above 10 ha up to 20 ha, the incentive increases to 1.10 and if the plot area is greater than 20 ha, the incentive available is 1.15

- For any basic ratio (LR/RC) exceeding 2.00 and up to 4.00, for a scheme area/plot area up to 0.40 ha, the incentive is 1.0. If the area falls within the range 0.4 ha up to 1 ha, the incentive available is 1.05. For schemes with plot area above 1 ha up to 5 ha, the incentive increases to 1.10. If the area falls within the range 5 ha up to 10 ha, the incentive available is 1.15. For schemes with plot area above 10 ha up to 20 ha, the incentive increases to 1.20 and if the plot area is greater than 20 ha, the incentive available is 1.25

- For any basic ratio (LR/RC) up to 2.00, for a scheme area/plot area up to 0.40 ha, the incentive is 1.10. If the area falls within the range 0.4 ha up to 1 ha, the incentive available is 1.15. For schemes with plot area above 1 ha up to 5 ha, the incentive increases to 1.20. If the area falls within the range 5 ha up to 10 ha, the incentive available is 1.25. For schemes with plot area above 10 ha up to 20 ha, the incentive increases to 1.30 and if the plot area is greater than 20 ha, the incentive available is 1.35


Please Note: Here, RC stands for the rate of construction regarding RCC Construction and Land Rate (LR) pertains to the Open Land rate for FSI 1.



## Regulations Update for Slum Rehabilitation



Sub regulation 33(10)(VIII) Clause 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 have been removed. As per the updated FSI norms for slum rehabilitation, the FSI to be granted on a Slum Rehabilitation scheme site can now surpass 3.0.


# 33. Guidelines on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed to Certain Categories under the 33(10)- Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)


## 3.8 Details on the Maximum FSI Permissible for Slum Rehabilitation Projects



The sanctioned FSI given to any slum site under the SRA Scheme will adhere to the highest figure between 4 or the sum total of rehabilitation Built-up Area (BUA) and incentive BUA. However, a minimum tenement density of 650 per net hectare must be maintained.



In situations where local planning imposes constraints or impacts the viability of a Slum Rehabilitation Project, the Chief Executive Officer of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) may decrease the tenement density norms to up to 25%, ensuring that the density does not fall below 500 per net hectare.



With such relaxations, the maximum permissible in-situ/total FSI must be limited to the collective FSI of rehabilitation and incentive BUA produced in the scheme post the relaxation. This FSI computation is applicable to both rehab and free-sale components, complying with the Regulation No. 31(1) directives.



While the areas stated in sub regulations No 6.6 and 8.2 are to be excluded from FSI computation, they will be incorporated into the computation for the rehab component. Furthermore, where the permissible in-situ FSI is not entirely utilized onsite, then the surplus FSI will be converted into Transferable Development Rights (TDR), as per Regulation No. 32.



The outlined FSI regulations exclude the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area(FCA) admissible as per Regulation 31(3).



# In-Situ Permissible FSI Based on Road Width for 33(10)- Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)


  
For a site with an access road ranging between 9.0m and less than 13.0 m, the permissible in-situ FSI is either 3.0 or up to the sanctioned FSI of the scheme, whichever number is higher, provided the building height aligns with regulation 19(2) guidelines.



For sites with access roads of 13.0m and above, the permissible FSI can go up to 4.00 or the sanctioned FSI of the scheme, whichever is higher. In cases of demonstrable hardship, the CEO of SRA will grant relaxation in marginal open spaces under regulation 41(5)(a)(iii). 



Nevertheless, a minimum Joint Open Space of 9m for buildings reaching above 32m and up to 70m, and 12m between two neighboring buildings for structures over 70 m but below 120 m, is mandatory. For buildings higher than 120 m, a joint open space of 15 m between two adjacent buildings is compulsory. However, the SRA CEO can relax it to 12 m after adequately recording the reasons. Compliance with CFO’s NOC is a prerequisite for granting these relaxations.


# Additional Floor Space Index for the Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under SRA Scheme



The SRA Scheme indicates certain privileges with regards to the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) as per the category 33(10). A unique FSI of 4.00 or the sanctioned FSI of the scheme, whichever ranks higher, is permitted for redevelopment involving slum dwellers on access roads having a width of 13.0 meters and beyond. There is provision for the relaxation in open marginal spaces under regulation 41(5)(a)(iii), granted by the CEO of Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), in instances where hardship can be demonstrably proven. 



To elaborate, buildings with a height ranging from 32 meters to 70 meters must maintain a minimum Joint Open Space of 9m. Buildings that rise above 70 meters but fall below 120 meters should have a 12-meter distance between two adjacent structures. Furthermore, buildings exceeding a height of 120 meters necessitate a joint open space of 15 meters between them. In situations of hardship, the SRA CEO can reduce this distance to 12 meters while recording the justification for such relaxation in writing. It is crucial to ensure compliance with the CFO's NOC for granted relaxations.



Also noteworthy is section 3.9, which provides an alternative for slum dweller society, NGO, or developers involved in the scheme. The option to claim TDR in exchange for the sale component of the scheme exists. This option is available when full permissible FSI can't be utilized due to limiting factors like height restrictions and uneconomical site conditions. Provision exists for permitting TDR only under circumstances where one complete building in the rehab component has been constructed, or when 10% of the rehab component has been erected on-site, with the TDR not surpassing 50% of the rehab component construction until its completion. Subsequent to the full construction of the rehab component, the balance TDR can be allowed.



According to section 3.10, the rehabilitation component entails all the residential and non-residential built-up premises, which are provided free of cost in compliance with the SRS outlines in this Regulation. This excludes those mentioned in Regulation No.31(1) but includes facilities like anganwadi, health center/outpost, community hall/gymnasium/fitness center, skill development center, entrepreneurship center for women, yuvakendra/library, eligible religious structures, public or charitable trust-run school, dispensary, and gymnasium, as per the provisions of 8.1 & 8.2. However, the built-up area allocated for buildable DP reservations is exempted.


#  Additional Floor Space Index Regulations for Slum Dweller Rehabilitation Projects


###  Permissible Floor Space Index Allowances for Redevelopment and Rehabilitation of Slum 



The first section of this document pertains to allowances for an extra Floor Space Index (FSI), focusing specifically on occasions related to the redevelopment for rehabilitation of slum dwellers, as per the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme. 



According to Regulation 33(10), a slum rehabilitation project on public authority land required for a vital public purpose may sanction a Transferable Development Right (TDR) for the area of the spared land to the owner of the stated unobstructed plot. Clarification is provided that the TDR may be permitted in return for the construction cost of the Built-up Area (BUA). 



The built-up area is measured as defined in Clause 3.2, and no sale component is allowed under this regulation. Rehabilitation projects may also be undertaken by the State Government, a Public Authority, or Government-owned and controlled companies, referred to as the Agency, conditional to approval from the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. 



The agency, within 270 days from the date of the letter of intent issuance, must identify the slum dwellers on government or public authority land needed for a vital public purpose. In case of the agency's failure to identify these slum dwellers, tenements may be offered to slum dwellers situated within 2 kilometers of the project land or anywhere in Greater Mumbai on government or public authority land.



The regulation further stipulates that in all cases, the relocation of slum dwellers should be considered in relation to the assembly of slum dwellers, with an aim to completely free land from slums, not merely patches of it. 



The document concludes that notwithstanding the abovementioned regulations, individuals affected by essential public projects taken up by MMRDA, including persons affected under the Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), are also eligible for the redevelopment scheme under this regulation, provided they are being resettled under the regulations specified in Government Resolution, Housing and Special Assistance Department, order no. 700/CR 31/slum-2 dated 12/12/2000 and have been certified by the Project Director, MUTP. These regulations are subject to amendments over time.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Certain Categories Under Regulation 33



##  Specific Rules for Redevelopment of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme) Under Regulation 33(10)



In relation to the redevelopment for rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under the SRA Scheme, these provisions extend to project-affected persons due to public projects of road widening and storm water drains undertaken by MCGM. These individuals are also eligible for redevelopment schemes under this regulation. MCGM acts as the planning authority for such instances, with the Municipal Commissioner possessing approval rights for these schemes as per the regulation.



Moreover, ongoing schemes under this provision where full commencement certificate/occupation permission is issued or work is completed pertaining to tenements of size 20.90 sq. m or less, at the discretion of the owner/developer—with consent of occupants and CEO (Slum Rehabilitation Authority) approval—can convert these tenements as per regulation. This scenario also makes the TDR for difference of carpet area permissible, however, land TDR is not permissible while granting additional TDR. 



This clause applies to other schemes under Regulation 33(10), especially where buildings are categorized as hazardous and dilapidated. 



Rehabilitation of Adivasi/encroacher in Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Adivasi/encroachers in AAREY Colony Government Land, when undertaken by a developer on government land, will be eligible for TDR concerning the construction of rehabilitation and resettlement tenements through a Government or implementing Government agency-run competitive Tender process.



These regulations also cover lands belonging to or leased out to a Public Authority, Statutory Authority, Public Sector undertaking, any Department of the Government of India, or a Joint Venture with any of them. Nevertheless, this is subject to the payment of premium for infrastructure development as stipulated under clause 9.2 of the regulation. 



As per section 3.12, all non-residential built-up areas factor into the computation of minimum density on a scale of 27.88 sq. m of carpet area being one tenement. In slums with existing tenement density surpassing 650 per net ha, the FSI calculation for all purposes shall be on gross area, i.e., without subtracting any percentage for recreational open space. This provision must still reserve the said recreational open space on-site, as per the guidelines in these Regulations.


#  Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provision for Certain Categories in Slum Redevelopment



##  Slum Dwellers Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme) under Article 33(10)



1. With regard to minimum 'Tenement Density on a Plot Including Non-Residential Units', in any Slum Rehabilitation Project, a minimum of 650 tenements per net hectare is necessary for effective rehabilitation. This computation specifically considers deductions pertaining to reservations that are practically implemented on-site, excluding any recreational/amenity open space.


2. When an SRA scheme is bound by the constraints of an in-situ FSI limited to 3.00, or according to regulations stated under Clause 3.8, the minimum tenement density would be 500 per net hectare.


3. In scenarios where the total tenements provided for all eligible hutment dwellers fall below the standard of 650 or 500 per net hectare, the discrepancy is expected to be offset by additional tenements offered without charge to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).


4. These excess tenements provided to the SRA are intended for use as transit accommodations, or for housing other project-affected individuals, pavement dwellers, or slum dwellers from alternative regions under the guidance and policies decreed by the GOM.


5. Any surplus FSI available following the development of rehab as well as sale components may be used for the additional rehabilitation of slum dwellers located on untenable land with the condition that the development remains within the boundary of maximum permissible FSI in the scheme.


6. The parameters of any ongoing Slum Rehabilitation Scheme where the eligibility of Slum Dwellers is revised and certified will also be revised in accordance with the aforementioned norms upon receiving certification of structural stability from competent government or semi-government institutions like IIT, VJTI.


7. If a slum redevelopment project has no eligible commercial slum dwellers and the provision of commercial tenements on ground floor is feasible, the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) may decide to provide commercial PAP tenements primarily of carpet area 20.90 sq. m (225 sq. ft.) or as required which shall be provided free of cost to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).





# Detailed Specifications for Allowing Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under SRA Scheme



## Section 33(10): Redevelopment of Slums under the SRA Scheme



The condition for allowing additional Floor Space Index (FSI) under the SRA Scheme is that if it is managed by a Federation or Co-operative Housing Society composed of serving or retired state government employees, Employees of the State Government Undertakings or Employees of local bodies of State Government for providing housing to its members. The additional tenements generated over and above those allocated for the existing eligible hutment dwellers should be transferred to the leaders of the said Federation or Co-operative Housing Society. The distribution is to be done under additional terms and conditions imposed by the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority to ensure adequate membership of class III and class IV employees. 



To ensure comprehensive and efficient rehabilitation of all slum dwellers including those declared eligible at later stages, the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme will take into account all slum dwellers based on certified slum plans and Draft Annexure-II. If the number of slum dwellers certified as eligible by Competent or Appellate Authority is less than the rehab tenements constructed under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme, the remaining tenements will be utilized by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority for rehabilitating unprotected occupants before 1st January 2011. Any remaining tenements will be utilized for the purpose of hosting transit tenants or Project Affected People (PAPs) or for accommodating pavement dwellers in the slum rehabilitation area. 



## Section 3.13: Amalgamation and Subdivision of Plots and Balancing of FSI Thereon



This section implies that any land determined as a slum rehabilitation area or on which a slum rehabilitation project has been approved, the plot numbers (represented as C.S. Nos or CTS Nos. or S. Nos or F. P. Nos) can be naturally amalgamated or subdivided. For this process, no separate approval for the amalgamation/subdivision of the land is necessary. 



## Section 3.14: Define Boundaries and Calculation of Slum Rehabilitation Area



The competent authority should declare the boundaries and size of the slum rehabilitation area after the actual measurement of the plot area on site. This measurement is to be adopted for planning purposes, including the calculation of density and floor space index.



## Section 3.15: Adjustment of Boundary for Building Designs by SRA CEO



The CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) holds the ability to adjust the boundary of the plot designated as a slum rehabilitation area. This is to accommodate the building’s design and provide proper access to the planned schemes. Furthermore, the area under the DP Road/Sanctioned Regular line road adjoining the SRS should be considered as part of the area to be developed under the scheme.


# 33. Specification for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotted to Certain Categories


## 33(10) - Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme) Specifications



The decision to approve a Slum Rehabilitation scheme may also involve further subdivision of the area, necessary to allot separate plots for rehabilitation and free sale components. Every lease agreement and Record of Right under this provision should explicitly state the Plot area and the built-up area in square meters for the prescribed plot.



In terms of the commitment of the district CTSO/SLR, it involves the adjustment of City Survey sheet and property cards on Government's decided fees.  This processing ensures that fresh property cards are created for each plot under the scheme. These cards will comprehensively detail the area of the plots, the total area of built-up floors, and Transferable Development Rights (TDR) that is, the deployed FSI on that specific plot.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) Scheme Redevelopment



## Guidelines and Restrictions for Temporary Transit Camps



 The multistoried temporary transit camp, designed for rehabilitation of slum dwellers under the SRA scheme, should be established on the site itself or outside the SRA project site. It should be located on a portion of the plot that is neither designated for public use, affected by road expansion, nor should it be far from the site.



Eligibility criteria state that slum dwellers should be relocated to the temporary transit camp or placed on rent. The decision on the method of accommodation should be a mutual agreement between the proposed society and the developer.



The designated area of temporary transit tenements should be excluded from the computation of the Floor Space Index (FSI). However, the safety and stability of the structure should be ensured by licensed structural consultants. The minimum area of an individual transit tenement should be 14.5 square meters.



 Building permission mandates alignment within 15 days from the date of application and subsequent project approval by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. If this does not occur, the permission is to be perceived as implicitly granted.



 On any nearby vacant site unrestricted by DP construction reservations, construction of temporary transit tenements from light, detachable materials such as tubular or prefabricated structures is approved up to an FSI of 4.0. This regulation applies in both the Island City and surrounding suburbs.



 In all cases incorporating temporary transit camps, the requirement exists for the structure's demolition within 30 days of granting Occupation Certificate to rehab structures. Work must be completed by the Developer, Society, or NGO. The site must be returned to its original state before any further action. Until full demolition, development rights for free sale area will not be granted beyond 75% of the total viable free sale area permissible under this Regulation.


# Detailed Analysis on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed to Certain Categories and Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



## 33(10) Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme): Elucidating the Important Guidelines



1. One of the key points under the SRA scheme is that the computation of the eligible existing area used for commercial, office, or economic activities is done based on actual measurement or inspection, as well as upon reference to official documents such as a License under the Shops and Establishment Act, Electricity bills and Photo passes.



2. Furthermore, in the rehabilitation component of the SRA scheme, the Built-Up Area (BUA) allocated for practices like commercial, office, shop, or economic activity that existed prior to a specific date determined by the Government will be granted, taking into account the provisions mentioned in the sub-regulation below.



3. It's noteworthy that if an individual possesses both residential and commercial premises without a common wall, and runs commercial, office, shop or economic activities in the slum or pavement area, they would be considered eligible for both a residential and commercial unit free of cost, including BUA for commercial, office, shop or economic activity, with the carpet area of the combined unit not exceeding 27.88 square meters.



4. In addition, the BUA for commercial, office, shop or economic activity that doesn't exceed a carpet area of 20.90 square meters, or the actual area if it's less, will be provided to the qualifying individual free of charge as a part of the rehabilitation project under the SRA scheme.



5. Definitions of key terms are also included in the regulations. For instance, the term carpet area refers to the net usable floor area within a tenement, excluding the areas covered by the walls or areas specifically exempted from the floor space index calculation in accordance with existing regulations.



6. Further guidelines indicate that such area may be authorized on any side of a plot bordering a 3.0-meter-wide pathway, and can derive access from a 3.0-meter-wide pathway or open space.



7. Another interesting point is about Non-Conforming Activities, which refers to all activities that were previously existing will be permitted to be relocated, despite the non-conforming nature of the activities, except those that are hazardous or highly polluting. 



8. Lastly, provisions involving Convenience Shopping in the Free-Sale Component are outlined as well as potential incentives provided to Society and NGOs through the Commercial Areas.



With a detailed analysis in the form of structured sentences, this segment ensures all key aspects related to the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme) are adequately highlighted.


# Overviews of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Certain Categories



## Additional FSI provided for Redevelopment Aimed at Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers - SRA Scheme



In the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) scheme, when the redevelopment is undertaken by a Co-operative Housing Society of slum dwellers, there is a provision to offer an additional 5% built-up area on the rehabilitation area without any costs for commercial purposes. This enhancement of Floor Space Index is aligned with the intent to foster economic viability and growth within the community. The Co-operative Housing Society representing hutment dwellers holds the discretion on this area.



It's critical to note that the corpus amount can't be spent. Instead, the income generated from this additional property or corpus will be utilized solely by the Society for the building and premises maintenance. It can also serve additional purposes prescribed by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



On the other hand, when a redevelopment plan is initiated by a Non-Government Organization, Government body, Public Authority, or Government Company, a further 5 percent Built-Up-Area (BUA) on the rehabilitation zone is granted at no cost for commercial use. While the majority of governance rests with the initiating bodies, the space is provided in association with the cooperative housing society. This provision serves to incentivize redevelopment projects undertaken by these entities while maintaining an equitable approach to the distribution of the additional FSI.

#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Categories: Focusing on Slum Dwellers Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme) under Regulation 33(10)



## Redevelopment Regulations Concerning Slum Rehabilitation and Its Associated Mandates 



According to Rule 6.15, all the relaxations previously discussed will be applicable to both the rehabilitation component and the composite buildings included in the project for Slum Rehabilitation under Regulation 33(10). Importantly, no premiums will be charged for any relaxations given for these rehabilitation and composite buildings. However, if the Chief Executive Officer grants any further relaxation in open spaces, it must comply with the CFO requirement and recovery of premium at the rate of 2.5% of ASR/READY RECKONER. 



In Slum Rehabilitation Schemes under this regulation, the amount of premium will be calculated based on the ASR/READY RECKONER rate prevalent at the time of the IOA's issue. This premium is collected at the time full occupation permission to the respective building is granted. However, note that this payment mode is not applicable for other redevelopment plans other than those under Regulation 33(10). All other redevelopment schemes will follow their specific regulations.






Under Rule 6.16, relaxations for the free sales component are available. The Relaxation included in sub-regulation No. 6.9 and other necessary relaxations are applicable to the free sale components, provided a premium at the rate of 2.5% of Ready Reckoner Rate or 10% of the normal premium (whichever is higher) is paid.






According to Rule 6.17, to ensure the viability of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS), the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) holds the competency to make any necessary relaxation. However, the reasons for these relaxations must be documented in writing.






Per Rule 6.18, for rehabilitation tenements under Regulations 33(10), car parking at the rate mentioned in Regulation 44 Table-21 should be provided. Alternatively, one parking space per tenement for two-wheelers should be offered. The allocation of these parking spaces is flexible and can be provided in any combination.





# Chapter 33: Exploring Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowances for specific categories


## Segment 33(10): Rehabilitating Slum Dwellers through Redevelopment (SRA Scheme)



Slums found within specified zones or reservations in the Development Plan will undergo development as stated in Regulation No. 17(3)(D). 



Paragraph 7.1 communicates the provision for redevelopment when slums and property owned by the municipality or MHADA are either co-located or contiguous. Utilization of both DCPR 33(7) and DCPR 33(10) regulations is permissible for the development of slum and adjoining non-slum areas. This condition can be applied only if the slum area comprises more than 51% of the total scheme area. The objective is to promote design flexibility and resource generation. The non-slum area's Floor Space Index (FSI), including the admissible Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), will be limited by the surrounding zone's allowance. The approval of these TDR plans rests with the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). The CEO of the SRA also has the authority to shift or interchange the existing amenity's purpose under D.C. Regulation 13(6). Road alignment shifts, however, need to be coordinated with the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). 



If a non-slum land, not classed as a Special Development Zone (SDZ), that has a zonal (basic) FSI of less than one in a residential zone, is adjacent to a slum plot eligible for development under 33(10), it can be amalgamated by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) if required for better planning. This merger is possible if 30% of the non-slum plot area is given to the Corporation, free of cost and encumbrance, for Provision of Services (POS) or amenity open space purposes. After the amalgamation, 70% of the area added to the slum scheme will be treated in a similar manner to non-slum residential plots that are part of the scheme. However, the usage of 'TDR' or 'Additional FSI on payment of premium' on such non-slum plot is not permissible. 



Making it clear, the SRA can execute slum rehabilitation projects on town planning scheme plots under specific conditions. Paragraph 7.2 highlights that slum rehabilitation projects can be initiated on Town Planning Scheme plots once they are identified as slums or slum rehabilitation areas. 



According to Paragraph 7.3, structures that contradict the adjoining final plots in the Town Planning Scheme may be integrated into the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme if they're officially pronounced as a slum rehabilitation area by the competent authority. 



Paragraph 7.4 states that for slum rehabilitation projects present near railway tracks, a boundary wall not less than 2.4 meters in height needs to be constructed for safety purposes.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Certain Categories: Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers under the SRA Scheme


## Requirements and Amenities for Slum Redevelopment



- For every multiple of 250 hutment dwellers, a health centre or outpost, Aaganwadi, skill development centre, women entrepreneurship centre, and library of 27.88 square meters must be present under the SRA scheme. These facilities, if misused, may be reallocated by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority to another public-serving organization or institution. 


- For every 100 rehabilitative tenements, an office space must be built for the associated co-operative housing society, aligning with D.C Regulations No. 37(9).


- A community hall is a mandatory part of the rehabilitation project for rehab buildings. The maximum area of such a hall should be the lesser of 2% of the rehabilitated built-up area or 200 square meters. 


- If determined necessary, religious structures may be retained during redevelopment but without attaining any increase in their original sizes. 


- Existing public or charitably run social infrastructure like schools, dispensaries, and gymnasiums may be preserved without any change in their pre-redevelopment area.


- In a slum rehabilitation project with less than 250 hutments, essential amenities will still be provided, consisting of a welfare hall, a 27.88 square meter office space for the co-operative housing society and any two above-mentioned amenities.


- It is possible for the CEO of the SRA to permit the accumulation of these amenities, while ensuring equitable service to the rehabilitated areas.



## Cost and FSI Allocation for Amenities in Slum Redevelopment



- Certain areas of the redevelopment project, like the Aaganwadi, health centre, community hall, fitness centre, skill development centre, women entrepreneurship centre, library, the society office, religious structures, and social infrastructure like school, dispensary, and gymnasium created by a public or charitable authority, are to be considered non-profit and form a part of the rehabilitation component. 


- These provisions are factored in during the computation of the free-sale component of the project, implying they are exempted from any cost or FSI charges.


- These cost-exemption rules apply equally to transit camp construction under DC Regulations 33(11).


# Detailed Information on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Certain Categories in Urban Redevelopment



This document provides pertinent details about the potential additional Floor Space Index (FSI) granted under specific circumstances. The main focus here is Section 33 of the document, with a particular emphasis on clause 33(10), which pertains to Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers, also known as the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) Scheme.



In the context of the SRA scheme, clause 8.3 highlights the type of structures whose floor space is not considered in the calculation of the permissible FSI. This includes various types of social infrastructure run by public authorities or charitable trusts. Specifically, the clause deems the floor space of Aaganwadis, health centres or outposts, community halls, gymnasiums, fitness centres, skill development centres, women entrepreneurship centres, Yuvakendra or library society offices, Balwadis, religious structures, schools, dispensaries, and gymnasiums as non-includable in the FSI computation. Notably, this provision stands regardless of whether the floor space calculation is performed for the purpose of defining the available FSI on a given site.


# Detailed Guidelines on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed for Slum Dwellers Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme)



## Conditions and Payment Specifications Under the Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers Initiative



The regulation under clause 33(10) states this: As a condition for the redevelopment for rehabilitation of slum dwellers, the owner, developer, or housing society, is required to deposit an amount of Rs. 40,000 per tenement with the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). This applies to every unit, including the welfare hall and balwadi in the rehabilitation component, as well as in the case of permanent transit camp tenements. The deposit schedule shall follow the timeline laid down by the CEO, SRA. However, by the time construction for occupation is completed, a total deposit equal to Rs. 40,000 times the number of tenements should have been fully made. Further, the last 25 percent of the free-sale building permission would only be granted after full payment of all required amounts to the SRA.



## Payment of Additional Rates Over and Above the Basic FSI for Infrastructure Improvement



Per clause 9.2, the rules are as follows: For any built-up area over the standard zonal (basic) FSI [not including compensatory or fungible areas], an additional payment equivalent to 2% of the ready reckoner rate in effect on the issuance date of the Letter of Intent (LOI), must be paid by the owner, developer, society, or NGO. This payment requirement also applies to the construction of permanent transit camps beyond the usually permissible FSI under DCR 33(11). Payment must be made following a timeline laid down by the CEO, SRA, but the installments can extend no longer than the completion of construction. Funds collected will be used for infrastructure improvement projects in slum or slum rehabilitation areas. These charges will be in addition to any development levies under section 124 of the MR&TP Act 1966.



## Allocation of Infrastructural Charges between MCGM and SRA



In addition, of the funds recovered as Infrastructure charges, 90% will be allocated to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), and 10% will remain with the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).


# Detailed Rules Regarding the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed for Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme) under Regulation 33(10)

## Clubbing under 33(10) 

### Parameters for Allowing Additional FSI:



The rehabilitation components devoted to the resettlement and rehabilitation of slums, in accordance with related policies, can have their sale components and additional FSI interchanged among two or more applicable schemes. An application for such interchange can be made by one or more developers, under the jurisdiction of this regulation, to club together more than one plot owned by either a single owner or multiple owners. The clubbing allows for resettlement and rehabilitation of slums on a singular plot while transferring the sale component and base FSI to other plots, given that all rights-holding individuals or entities agree and collectively submit an application. However, it is mandatory that such clubbing results in an independent plot, building, or wing with tenements being given to the Planning Authority.



### Premium on Interchanged Sale Component:



The developer is required to pay a premium, equal to 30% of the sale value, for the unearned income from the interchanged Built Up Area (BUA) of the sale component, as per the ASR/Ready Reckoner.



### Restrictions and Requirements for Clubbing Schemes:



Clubbing of more than one scheme under this regulation with a scheme under clause 3.11 of Regulation 33(10) or 33(11) attracts a premium at the rate of 40% of the sale of interchanged BUA, which is counted as unearned income. In case a scheme is deemed non-viable and the CEO of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority instructs to compulsorily club it with another scheme under this Regulation, a premium is charged at 20% of the ASR/Ready Reckoner. Clubbing of such schemes can be executed within the 'Island City', 'Western Suburbs & Extended Suburbs', and 'Eastern Suburbs & Extended Suburbs'. Moreover, clubbing of such schemes is allowed in the neighboring ward, regardless of location. 



### Precedence and Exceptions for Clubbed Schemes:



For the schemes where clubbing was previously permitted under the earlier DCR, the same shall continue for slum dwellers who become eligible at a later stage. This rule, however, does not apply to plots where the permissible Zonal F.S.I. is less than 1.00. 



### Utilization of Premium Amount:



The premium collected from the rehabilitation scheme under this regulation is to be deposited separately, dedicated as a shelter fund serving the State of Maharashtra.



### Determination of Rehab Carpet Area:



In the content of Regulation 33(10), wherever the carpet area of rehab tenements is described as 25 sq.mt., it should be comprehended as 27.88 sq.mt.


# Detailed Guidelines and Regulations Regarding Additional Floor Space Index for Certain Categories: Emphasis On Redevelopment for Rehabilitation of Slum Dwellers (SRA Scheme)



## Guidelines Pertaining to Redevelopment Projects for Slum Rehabilitation (SRA Scheme)



Provisions under Regulation 9(6) are deemed applicable for slum rehabilitation redevelopment initiatives. It should, however, be noted that projects where Letter of Intent (LOI) has been granted will be treated in accordance with the Development Control Regulations (DCR) provisions that were in place on the LOI issuance date. In situations where a project requires a revised LOI, a change of developer or any other amendment, including recording and resubmission without altering the defined slum boundary, the DCR provisions in effect at the time will be applicable.



For combined or amalgamated schemes, and for projects that have been sanctioned under different regulations (both previous and current ones), the FSI calculations should adhere to the DCR regulations that existed on the LOI issuance dates of the aforementioned schemes.



### Exceptions to the SRA Scheme Regulations



For slum rehabilitation schemes that were approved prior to the enforcement of these current regulations, they will remain guided by the rules applicable before these were introduced, given that a) a LOI has been issued by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) before the enforcement date of these updated regulations, and b) the LOI is still valid and has not been sought for revision.



In instances where the Slum Rehabilitation (S.R.) Scheme, sanctioned by the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), is taking place on reservations as outlined by the sanctioned scheme, it will remain valid and continue.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to be Granted to Specific Categories in Development Projects

## 33(10)(A)- Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)

The document segment focuses on the provision of an increased Floor Space Index (FSI) to certain categories. The specific category discussed within this markdown section revolves around the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).



## The Provision of Additional FSI To The Slum Rehabilitation Scheme(SRA) of Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



The areas to be redeveloped by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) cover the redevelopment of hutments located within slum areas in the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA). These areas are integral parts of the entire DRP area. 



The overall Floor Space Index (FSI) of the entire DRP area is stipulated as 4.00. The provision of FSI for the specified plots within DRP will adhere to the guidelines that follow. 



This structure enables the clear differentiation of the FSI entitlement on specific plots under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme within the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, compared to other potential categories or projects to be included in the larger text corpus.


# Details Regarding the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories within Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Provision Clarifications for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



The regulatory provisions of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) apply to the redevelopment of slums, inclusive of pavements. These rules are applicable where the inhabitants' names and structures are listed in the electoral rolls prepared on or prior to January 1, 2000. However, it is critical to note that these provisions only apply if the inhabitants are currently residing in these structures. In such situations, the basis of application is an independently numbered structure exchanged for a tenement.



Adhering to these regulatory provisions, only the actual occupants of the hutments are considered eligible. This suggests that so-called structure owners, if they are not actual occupants but their names appear in the electoral roll for the structure, have no rights to the reconstructed tenement against that structure. It's an essential aspect within the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) policy for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Redevelopment Project.

###  Key Definitions & Guidelines Pertaining to DRP in the Context of Slum Rehabilitation within Dharavi DNA



- For the purposes of Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), the term 'slum' is defined as those areas that are censused, declared, and notified under the Maharashtra Slum Areas (Improvement, Clearance and Redevelopment) Act. 1971 at any time. This definition also includes areas of pavement stretches, proposed roads, railway lands, regions under electric H.T. power lines, and Nalla banks that are thereafter deemed to form part of the DRP Area.



- An area that qualifies as a 'slum' as per section 4 of the Slum Act and has been censused, declared, and notified will be treated as DRP Area.



- The DRP Area further includes any regions declared by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) that fulfil the conditions in section 4 of the Slum Act to qualify as a slum. If the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) approves a DRP scheme within the DNA, those areas are also designated as the DRP Area.



- Any region proposed or required for constructing temporary or lasting transit camps and associated projects on any land adjacent to approved developments by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), will be treated as DRP Area.



- The term 'pavement' refers to any Municipal or Government or SemiGovernment pavement that is deemed suitable for implementing the DRP scheme.



- A 'structure', in the context of the DRP, refers to residential areas of individuals enumerated as living in a single house as per the electoral roll data up to 1st January 2000.



- A 'composite building' is defined as a building having both rehabilitation and free-sale components, along with any built-up amenity proposed within the same structure.



- 'Censused' refers to slums situated on lands belonging to the Government, a Government undertaking, or MCGM recorded as having been censused in 1976, 1980, 1985, 1995, or before 1st January 2000.



- 'Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)' is referred to the geographical extent of Dharavi delegated to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) as the special planning authority for planning and development as per the notification no.TPB-4304/322/CR-56/04/UD-11 dt. 9/3/2005 and no. TPB-4308/3499/CR-83/09/UD-11 dtd. 25.6.2009.

In the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA), particular emphasis is placed on the concept of the 'Planning sector'. This term refers to a plot of land comprised of C.S. Nos. or CTS Nos., either partially or wholly derived from DNA, and typically bounded predominantly by existing major roads, railway lines, village boundaries and proposed major roads. This strategic categorization encourages a well-orchestrated, controlled development of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).



Moreover, it enhances the supply of many essential amenities and facilities to the society within the defined boundaries of such plots or areas. These delineated plots or areas are referred to as 'Planning sectors'. The specific area and count of these planning sectors would adhere strictly to the approval received from the Committee of Secretaries, specifically appointed to oversee DRP on the official account of the Housing Department - No. Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)/2003/CR189/SI-1A, dated. 4.2.2004, also known as the Committee of Secretaries.


# Detailed Description of Admissible Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Categories Specifically Related to Slum Rehabilitation Schemes



In the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), stipulated by section 33(10)(A), there are a few critical aspects to be highlighted. 



- Firstly, the reconstructed tenement, under this scheme, is confirmed to be co-owned by the hutment dweller and his or her spouse. 


- Secondly, the record of their ownership will be duly registered in the books of the newly formed cooperative housing society, a mandatory step post-allotment of the completed rehabilitation building. 


- An essential role here is played by the Assistant Registrar of societies, notably operating under the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), who ensures the formal documentation process is properly undertaken. 


- Furthermore, this ownership registration process includes acquiring the share certificates and other pertinent documents indication legitimate possession. 



Thus, these specificities clearly define the category of beneficiaries for additional FSI under the given sub-section in the broader Slum Rehabilitation Scheme.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Specific Categories 



As per section 33(10)(A), regarding the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), there are key points to note. 



Firstly, the Officer on Special Duty for the DRP (OSD, DRP), under the purview of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), holds the capability to denotify the Dharavi Redevelopment Project area. This action could be taken out of the need determined by the OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)) or as instructed by the state Government of Maharashtra (GoM). The context and purpose of this denotification are principally related to decisions regarding the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) which may be granted to some categories within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the advancement of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP). 



So, in summary, the special protocol 33(10)(A)- Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) allows for potential Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allowances if the OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)) deems it necessary, or is directed to do so by the State Government of Maharashtra (GoM).


# Detailed Examination on the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicability and Rights of Hutment Dwellers in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)




## In-depth Discourse on the Conditions for Allowing Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



The Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), directed by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA), employs specific regulations for the reconstruction or redevelopment of accommodations for hutment or pavement dwellers. These special provisions are set by the SRA, and the redevelopment process is to be conducted by a developer selected via a competitive bidding system. This developer must have the approval of the committee constituted as per the Housing Department Resolution No. Zopuyo 2003/CR-189/Zopsu-1 dated 4.2.2004. These regulations exclusively apply to properties encompassed within the DRP and do not apply to properties that are not a part of the DRP.



Properties that are not part of the DRP will be developed as indicated by Regulation No. 30 only. The properties not involved in DRP are also exempt from the other provisions of the DCR allowing higher FSI, provisions that are permissible under Regulation No 33.




## Comprehensive Analysis of the Rights of Hutment Dwellers in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



Hutment dwellers possessing carpet areas up to 27.88 sq. m (300 sq.ft.) in the slum or on the pavement, and meet the eligibility criteria as per the provisions of DCR 33(10)(A), shall obtain a residential tenement of equivalent carpet area, free of cost. This includes a separate living room, kitchen, bedroom, bath, and water closet—excluding common areas.



Hutment dwellers with residential areas larger than 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft.) are eligible for residential tenements with a total carpet area of 37.16 sq. m (400 sq. ft.). Of this total area, a 27.88 sq. m (300 sq. ft.) area will be free of cost, and the area above this, measuring 9.29 sq. m (100 sq. ft.), will be provisioned at a construction cost determined by OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)). The cost shall be paid by the hutment dweller to the developer.



The carpet area, as referred to above, is the net usable floor area within a tenement that is exempt from floor space index computation as per the then/prevailing regulation but includes free of FSI balcony areas, if permitted, as per the then regulation. 



All eligible hutment residents involved in the DRP must adhere to the regulations specified hereby and conform to the rehabilitation provisions, regardless if it within the same sector or other sectors within the DRP jurisdiction.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) under Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)


## Rules of Rehabilitation for Pavement and Hutment Dwellers in DRP Area


- Residents of the slums, specifically pavement dwellers and hutment dwellers, residing on lands vital for urgent public utility or purpose, hazardous locations, or those influenced by Development Plan (DP) actions will not be in-situ rehabilitated. Instead, they will be accommodated in other accessible plots within the jurisdiction of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).


  
## Criteria for Eligibility Establishment in DRP


- An extract from the relevant electoral roll, legally verified, will be deemed sufficient proof for establishing a person's eligibility, given that they are found residing in the slum. This measure aims to prevent individuals who have left the slum from claiming a free tenement under the scheme, even if they have typically relocated to a non-slum area or outside the DRP Zone.


  
## Conditions for Hutment Dwellers at Other Locations in Brihan Mumbai


- If hutment dwellers are discovered living in the structure, but their names are registered on the electoral roll at other slum or pavement locations in Brihan Mumbai before 1st Jan 2000, they will be deemed eligible, but only at their current residence. Disputes or doubts will be settled by a Competent Authority appointed by the Government in the Housing Department; their decision will be binding on all parties.


  
## Agreement Requirements for Eligible Hutment Dwellers under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project


- An individual agreement is expected to be formed between the developer elected under the DRP by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and the eligible hutment dwellers of each slum/pavement structure.


  
## Agreement Conditions for Land-owning Authorities, SRA, Developers, and Hutment Dwellers 


- The agreement between the hutment dwellers and the land-owning authority, Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), or developer will bear the joint names of the pramukh hutment dweller and their spouse for every structure.


  
## Allotment Priority for Physically Handicapped Persons and Female-headed Households in DRP Area


- Hutments that house a physically handicapped person or are governed by females will receive first preference in the allocation of tenements. Following that, lots will be drawn for the remaining tenements amongst other hutment dwellers.


  
## Guidelines for Transfer of Photo Passes under DRP


- There will be no need to regulate transfer of photo passes that have taken place to date since only current occupants will qualify for redevelopment under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).


  
## Eligibility Exemption for Non-slum Dwellers in DRP Area 


- Any individual registered in a non-slum section of Brihan Mumbai but who has bought a hutment in the DRP area, thereby having their name incorporated in the electoral roll for the slum area, will not be eligible under the scheme.


# Detailed Insight into the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories: A Closer Look at the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## 33(10)(A) -Government/MCGM/MHADA Land Lease Details for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)



- For the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) as a part of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), that portion of Government/MCGM/MHADA land designated for the rehabilitation component will be lease-held by the Cooperative Housing Society of slum-dwellers for a duration of 30 years. 


- An annual lease rent of Rs. 1001 for every 4000 sq. m. of land or part thereof will be charged; the lease can be renewed for additional 30-year periods.


- The land under free sale component will be leased directly to the Society/Association of purchasers of the tenement under free sale component, with provisions in place for further 30-year renewals. The lease rent for the free sale component will be determined by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).


- The Developer/Co-op Housing Society are obligated to pay a premium at the rate of 25% of ASR/READY RECKONER for SRS on lands owned by the Government, Semi-Government undertakings, and Local Bodies. This premium is payable to the land-owning authority, which may include MHADA, MCGM, MMRDA, with the installment recovered to be remitted to the concerned authority within 30 days of recovery.


- The premium for Government land will be deposited in Nivara Nidhi, and its recovery will be in installments as prescribed by the Government. Any proposals for SRS on land owned by the Central Government will only be approved following the receipt of a NOC from the concerned department.



## 33(10)(A) Guidelines for Vacant Land Tenure and Recovery of Pending Dues for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme 



- When any part of the land designated for slum rehabilitation under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) is under vacant land tenure, such tenure/lease created by MCGM or Municipal Commissioner will automatically be nullified once the DRP proposal has been submitted for approval to the DRP cell of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).


- Any outstanding dues to MCGM will not affect the issuance of any certificate or NOC related to DRP.


- Pending charges (such as assessment, compensation, occupational charges, non-agricultural tax/dues, etc.) with public authorities like the State Govt, MHADA, MCGM will be handled independently and will not obstruct the granting of DRP approval or building permissions.



## 33(10)(A) Measures for Non-compliant Hutment Dwellers in the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme 



- In the event that eligible hutment dwellers within the scheme do not willingly participate in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), provisions will be made for them in the renewal/rehabilitation part of the scheme.


- The transit tenement allocation for these individuals will also be delineated along with those who have willingly joined the project.


# Detailed Overview of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Provisions for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) under Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA)


## Conditions and Penalties for Non-compliance in Dharavi Redevelopment Project


Individuals who fail to join the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) within 15 days of the developer's notification of their unwillingness to OSD, DRP may face actions under the relevant provisions of the Slum Act. This could result in the removal of their structures to ensure no interruption for other residents who have willingly partaken in the scheme.



## Limited Benefits for Late Joiners in Dharavi Redevelopment Project


After actions against defaulters under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) have commenced, those individuals lose their eligibility for transit tenements. They can only choose from what remains after others have made their selections, which could potentially be situated on the same site or elsewhere.



## Loss of Tenement Rights in Dharavi Redevelopment Project


Residents who fail to join the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) until building permissions are granted forfeit their right to any built-up tenement. Their tenements could be repurposed by the SRA for housing pavement dwellers and other displaced slum dwellers.



## Small Pitch Allotment in Dharavi Redevelopment Project


A substitute pitch of approximately 3m x 3.5m might be available for affected residents of Dharavi Redevelopment Project to construct their dwellings at their own expense.



## Women Representation in the Managing Committee of Co-operative Housing Society


The managing committee of the co-operative housing society, formed post-allotment of reconstructed tenements under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, is required to include women to the extent of one-third of the total strength of actual members.



## Restriction on Tenement Transfer under Dharavi Redevelopment Project


Tenement owners are not permitted to sell, lease, assign, or transfer their tenements received under this scheme for a period of ten years from the date of allotment or possession. Exceptions apply for transfers to legal heirs. Non-compliance with this condition could result in the Slum Rehabilitation Authority reclaiming the tenements.



## Rights and Compensation of Land Owning Authority in Dharavi Redevelopment Project


Under the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, the concerned land owning authority is allowed to grant development rights on their land to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority in lieu of 70% of the net premium payable by developers. This premium is proportionate to the Rehab Component generated on the said land. Differential treatment is applied if a project is undertaken by the Public Authority or in cases where land is deemed unusable for building construction. In those circumstances, the premium or compensation is decided by the Committee of Secretaries (CoS).





# Detailed Information on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted Within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



### Submission Procedures and Approval Guidelines for DRP Proposals under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA)



Each planning sector proposal for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) must be submitted to the DRP cell of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), complete with all relevant documents, no-objection certificates, and plans as deemed necessary by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



The approval for the DRP project is the responsibility of the DRP cell of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and must be granted within 60 days of submission of all necessary documents. In cases where the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) fails to provide approval within this timeframe, approval will be presumed granted as long as the project aligns with the existing regulatory provisions.



In granting approval for DRP, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) reserves the right to include necessary terms and conditions.



The DRP must adhere to the procedure detailed in the MR&TP Act, 1966 when seeking building permissions for any proposed development under this scheme.



Once all terms and conditions are met, the building permission will be granted following the provisions of Section 45 of the MR&TP Act, 1966, prioritizing the Rehabilitation component before the free sale component, barring deviations specified in relevant clauses.



### Ensuring A Balance between Rehabilitation and Free Sale Components



In order to maintain a correlation between the Rehabilitation and Free Sale components, building permissions for 10 percent of built-up areas (BUA) may be granted simultaneously for both components. Further proportional permissions will be granted as decided by the OSD, DRP, and Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).



Upon project approval (noted in the Letter of Intent), a No Objection Certificate (NOC) for building permissions from the landowning authority must be granted within 60 days for lands owned by any state department, undertaking, agency, including MHADA and local self-government like the MCGM. In the event of a denial of the NOC, stated reasons must be provided. The NOC will be considered granted if not provided within the specified period.



Lastly, for any sectoral development under DRP on lands owned by any state department, undertaking, agency, including MHADA and local self-governments like MCGM, the issuance of an Occupation Certificate will not be delayed simply due to pending lease documentation execution.


# Detailed Overview of Proposed Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) under Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Section 33(10)(A) - Proposed Additional FSI for SRA inside DNA for DRP 



The FSI allotted for the rehabilitation of qualifying slum/pavement residents includes both the FSI for the rehabilitation portion and the FSI for the section available for free sale. The FSI ratio between both these components will adhere to guidelines laid down in this section.



Built-up Area (BUA) for the rehabilitation component is defined as the sum total construction area of the rehabilitation aspect, excluding the areas mentioned in the 31(1) of D.C. Regulations. It includes passages, anganwadi, community hall, gymnasium, skill development centre, welfare centres, and other social infrastructure as allowed by the Government Home Department Resolution on 05/05/2011 and 18/11/2015.



The proportional relationship between the rehabilitation's actual and additional BUA is explained. If the rehabilitation component amounts to 10 sq. m of BUA, an extra 13.33 sq. m of BUA is granted, which can be disposed of in the open market while subsidizing the rehabilitation component.



When the FSI needed for rehabilitating present hutment occupants plus the free sale component surpasses an FSI of 4.00 for a specific plot, such excess will be normalized while computing an overall FSI of 4.00 for the entire DRP area. FSI norms in Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) within DNA will abide by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) notifications updated periodically.



Clarification on the precise definition of the rehabilitation component is provided, including the residential and non-residential portions provided free of cost as per the provisions of the DRP policy, with reference to regulation 31(1) Including facilities mentioned in the previously mentioned Government Resolution.



Minimum Density requirement on the plot inclusive of Non-Residential Units is defined. The minimum density of the rehabilitation component on a plot is set to be 650 tenements per net hectare, calculated post-deductions of all on-site reservations but excluding the recreational or amenity open space left. If the number of tenements to be provided to the hutment dwellers is less than the minimum, the difference will be provided to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) free of cost. The Authority will use these for transit or for relocating project-affected persons, pavement dwellers or more slum dwellers from other slums.


# Theme 33: Additional Allowances in Floor Space Index (FSI) - Specifics for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA)



## 33(10)(A) - Rules for DRP in the Dharavi Notified Area as a Part of SRA 



For the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA), there are specific guidelines. These cater to aspects such as the computation of minimum density, treatment of non-residential Built-Up Area (BUA), Floor Space Index (FSI) calculation, plot amalgamation, and boundary adjustments. 



Guideline 3.7 underlines that all non-residential BUA must be considered in the computation of minimum density. It establishes that one tenement is equated to 27.88 sq.m. of carpet area. The calculation of FSI for all purposes must be based on the gross area, that is, without deducting any space allocated for recreational or amenity purposes. This, however, does not impact the necessity of reserving said open space physically on site, in accordance with the regulations.



In terms of amalgamation and subdivision of plots, guideline 3.8 states any land declared as DRP Area or upon which DRP has been sanctioned is treated as a natural amalgamation or subdivision if it spreads across part or parts of C.S. Nos. or CTS Nos. or S. Nos. or F.P. No. In such cases, no separate approval is required for amalgamation or subdivision of land.



The OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority, SRA) may, as per rule 3.10, adjust the boundary of the plot declared as DRP Area to suit the building design or provide proper access to the Project or any other plots within the sectors. 



Once the DRP has been approved, as per guideline 3.11, the area may be further subdivided if required, to earmark separate plots for the rehabilitation component, amenity plot, and the free sale component. The Plot area and the BUA, in terms of square meters on the said plot, must be explicitly mentioned in the lease agreements and the Record of Rights.



Finally, guideline 3.12 sets the responsibility of ensuring that the city survey sheet and property cards are corrected accordingly on the Settlement Commissioner, Maharashtra State. A fee may be charged by the Government for this service. Fresh property cards must be created for each of the plots with complete details regarding the area of the plots and the total area of the floors of the built-up property and TDR given, that is, the FSI used on that plot.


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Situations in Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Temporary Transit Accommodation Regulations and Guidelines



1. Under Regulation 33(10)(A) in the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), temporary transit camps or accommodations must be provided within the DNA or nearby lands. This must come with prior approval of the DRP, if necessary, even on the area of the statutory open space stipulated by Regulation No. 27 on the plot.


   
2. Temporary transit accommodations can be established within DNA, even on amenity open space areas, excluding locations designated as D.P. roads or open space reservations, following a regulated procedure.



3. On slum sites approved for rehabilitation, construction of multistory temporary transit tenements is allowed.



4. The area occupied by the temporary transit tenements must not be included in the calculation of the Floor Space Index (FSI), but the structural safety of these accommodations must be verified.



5. Building permissions for these accommodations should be issued within 15 days of the application submission by the appointed developer of a sector. If this does not happen, the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), should consider the permission as granted.



6. Construction of temporary transit tenements made of light material on vacant sites without any DP reservation is permissible up to an FSI of 4.0. The term 'Temporary' stands for structures made from detachable materials such as tubular, prefabricated light structural, or other materials approved by OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority). 



7. In cases where a temporary transit camp is erected, the developer must demolish the structures within 30 days of receiving an intimation from the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). The site should then be restored to its original state as per the phased development program approved by the DRP cell.


# Subject 33: Specifics of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Approved for Various Categories and the Structure of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) Deployed in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) 



In accordance with the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) under regulation 33(10)(A) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), the intended area available for commercial, office, shops, industrial establishments, and structures for potter's business activities will be assessed based on facts from actual measurements and inspections or by reviewing official documentations, such as License under Shops and Establishment Act, Trade License, Factory License, Electricity bills, and Photo passes.



Eligibility for the rehabilitation initiative includes any commercial area or place for economic activities like offices, shops, and potters' structures that have been in existence since or before January 1, 2000. In cases of separate residential and commercial premises (without a common wall), the individual will be entitled to both a residential unit as well as the Built-Up Area (BUA) for their commercial establishment, neither of which would entail any cost.



For incorporated commercial and industrial structures, the provided BUA up to 20.90 sqm (or 225 sqft) or lesser, depending on the actual area, will be allocated to the eligible person as part of the rehabilitation plan without any cost. The remaining area, if exceeding 20.90 sqm, can be sold in accordance with the succeeding table's parameters about the saleable areas exceeding 20.90 sqm for the DRP under the SRA in the DNA.



- In the context of the DRP for SRA, within DNA, a carpet area between 225 sq.ft and 250 sq.ft is offered free of cost as part of the rehabilitation component, with no additional areas provided at further costs. 


- For a carpet area range of 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft, a free of cost area of 225 sq.ft is provided. Additional areas ranging from 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft are offered at a price without qualifying as an incentive sale area with a 10% reduction. 


- For existing carpet areas between 1001 sq.ft and 1500 sq.ft, a free of cost area of 225 sq.ft is provided. An additional area ranging from 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft comes at a price without qualifying as an incentive sale area, having a 10% reduction. Plus, an extra carpet area between 1001 sq.ft to 1500 sq.ft is made available at a cost without being part of an incentive sale area, brought with a 20% reduction.


- For existing carpet areas greater than or equal to 1501 sq.ft, a free of cost area of 225 sq.ft is offered. Additional areas are provided at various costs and reductions without qualifying as incentive sale area, 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft with 10% reduction, 1001 sq.ft to 1500 sq.ft with 20% reduction, and areas greater than or equal to 1501 sq.ft with 30% reduction.



The proviso here is that the industrial units allowed under this program must exclusively be non-polluting and non-hazardous. If the rehabilitation area is found exceeding 20.90 sqm or 225 sqft, the construction cost is determined by the Officer on Special Duty (OSD), DRP, which is affiliated with the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). This thus accrued cost will be payable by the hutment dweller to the project developer. 



The enactment also encompasses the structural components of activities related to the potters' business.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allotment Under Subsection 33(10)(A) of Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



This document discusses the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to be allocated for specific categories, under the 33(10)(A) - Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA), proposed for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP). The Basic Use Area (BUA) structures of Potters' Business Activity up to 20.90 sq. m (225 sq. ft.) carpet area or the actual area (whichever is lesser), will be supplied to eligible individuals without any cost under the rehabilitation project. However, any area in excess of 20.90 sq.m may be sold, if needed, in a predefined manner.



In the context of subsection 33(10)(A) of the SRA within the DNA for the DRP, the table depicts the carpet area range of Potters’ business structures above 20.90 sq.m and how these areas might be sold by the tenant.



- For an existing carpet area ranging between 225 sq.ft to 250 sq.ft, a carpet area of 225 sq.ft will be provided at no cost, as part of the Rehab component.


- For tenants with an existing carpet area ranging between 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft, a carpet area of 225 sq.ft will be provided free of cost, and an additional carpet area ranging from 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft will be provided with a 10% reduction.


- Tenants with an existing carpet area ranging between 1001 sq.ft to 1500 sq.ft will receive 225 sq.ft free of cost, 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft with a 10% reduction, and 1001 sq.ft to 1500 sq.ft with a 20% reduction.


- For an existing carpet area of 1501 sq.ft or more, the provided carpet area will include 225 sq.ft free of cost, 251 sq.ft to 1000 sq.ft with a 10% reduction, 1001 sq.ft to 1500 sq.ft with a 20% reduction, and 1501 sq.ft and above with a 30% reduction.



The rehabilitated area in excess of 20.90 sq. m (225 sq. ft.) will be sold at construction cost, as decided by the Office of the Special Duty (OSD), DRP/Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). The calculated cost will then be paid by the hutment dweller to the developer. 



As per section 5.4, this area can be allowed on any side of the plot as long as it borders at least a 6.0 m-wide pathway and gains access from a similarly wide public space. Ground floor back-to-back shopping is also permitted for rehabilitation purposes. After these provisions are exhausted, the area can be allowed on the first floor as needed.



According to section 5.5, any pre-existing activities can be relocated, regardless of their non-conformity. Exceptions include those activities which are dangerous and highly polluting or when the individual has already been allocated alternative accommodation elsewhere by the MCGM.



Under section 5.6, Non-Residential Users that are permissible in R and C zones, as per DCR 34, will be permitted in Free Sale Components.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allocation for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## 33.10(A) Definitions and Requirements for Residential Rehab/Renewal Tenements



- A residential rehab/renewal tenement within the context of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) must have distinct components. These include a separate living room, kitchen, bedroom, water closet unit, bathroom, and an enclosed balcony merged within the carpet area of the tenement.



## 33.10(B) Zone Restrictions and Balcony Provisions


 
- For DRP rehab tenements in DNA, there will be no restrictions on zone. The presence of a balcony should not reduce the marginal open space to less than 2.0 m for the calculation of area of 27.88 sq. m and 37.16 sq. m size of rehab tenements. The balcony's area will be included in this calculation.



## 33.10(C) Passage Provisions for Rehab Component Accesses


 
- Contrary to other regulations for DRP rehab tenements in DNA, common passages should have a width not less than 2.0 m to provide access to residential tenements and commercial/industrial units. Any corridors under a proposed podium up to 12.00 m in width for rehab and renewal commercial/industrial units & amenities are not counted towards FSI when computing 4.00 FSI on site. These common passages will form part of the rehab component and the free sale component will be calculated based on this.



## 33.10(D) Free of FSI Corridors


 
- Corridors under the podium giving access to the sale commercial component up to 12.00 m in width in the context of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) are also considered free of FSI.



## 33.10(E) Open Space Requirements for Buildings


 
- Buildings up to 32 m in height in the rehab component or composite building for the ground + 1 podium proposed to accommodate rehab commercial/industrial units and sale commercial areas in composite structures should have front and marginal open space of at least 3.0 m.



## 33.10(F) Front Marginal Open Space Specifications


  
- Despite Regulation No. 41 Table No 18, if the location of the plot for DRP rehab tenements in DNA abuts DP Road with a width of 18.3 m and above, the front marginal open space should be at least 3.00 m, provided it is not an express highway or road wider than 52 m.



## 33.10(G) Marginal Open Space Provisions Near Nallahs


 
- If the plot location for DRP rehab tenements in DNA abuts a nallah, there is no requirement for marginal open space beyond 6 m from the edge of the trained nallah.



## 33.10(H) Distance between Rehab/Composite Buildings


 
- The distance between any two rehab/composite buildings for the DRP in DNA should not be less than 6 m for buildings up to 32 m in height. For buildings taller than 32 m, open spaces should follow Regulation No 41(5).



## 33.10(I) Rehabilitation and Free Sale Component Proportions


 
- A composite building within the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) should contain at least 40 percent of the built-up area as rehabilitation components.



## 33.10(J) Consideration of Additional Open Space


 
- Any additional area provided more than the minimum front and marginal spaces for DRP rehab tenements in DNA may be considered part of the Amenity Open Space (AOS) in the project. This is applicable for projects that comprise both rehabilitation and free sale components, without charging any premium in relaxation of the stipulations in DCR No.27, if necessary.



## 33.10(K) Building and Pathway Affiliations


 
- Pathways may serve as access if necessary for buildings within the context of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA). In such cases, buildings are allowed to touch these pathways.





# Detailed Review of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Categories within Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Regulation Based Guidelines for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



1. In adherence to the provisions of Regulation No. 23, the means of access in the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) is typically defined. However, if a project's design requires relaxation, it may be considered. Access through existing pathways and roads maintained under Section 63K of the MMC Act, 1888, possessing a minimum width of 3.6 m, is deemed adequate for any slum rehabilitation project. The structures within these projects may reach a height of up to 32 m, including stilts.



2. For the planning of the rehabilitation subplot to be viable within the DRP, suppose the Amenity Open Space (AOS) is decreased. In that case, a minimum of 15 percent of Amenity Open Space (AOS) must still be maintained. 



3. In accordance with the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), premiums will not be applied for the exclusion of a staircase and lift well, as defined under the provisions of DCR 31(1).



4. All provisions for relaxation within the DRP are extended to the rehabilitation component and mixed-use buildings within the project. Furthermore, premium charges will not apply for any of the given relaxations or any others mentioned in the DCR 31(1). However, should further open space relaxations be considered, such relaxations will depend on compliance with CFO requirements and premium recovery at a rate of 2.5% of the Annual Schedule of Rate. 



## Relaxations and Penalties within the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme 



5. For the free sale component, relaxations defined under sub-regulation Nos. 6.6, 6.7, 6.11, 6.12, and 6.13, along with any necessary additional relaxation, will apply to the free sale components for deficient areas, subject to premium payment at a 2.5% rate of ASR/READY RECKONER for open land (for FSI 1) or 10% of the standard premium (whichever is higher). 



6. To ensure the financial viability of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA), the OSD, DRP, reserves the right to offer necessary relaxations as needed, provided reasons are documented in writing. Premium charges will be calculated at a 2.5% rate of ASR/READY RECKONER of open land (for FSI 1) or 10% of the normal premium (whichever is higher).


# Detailed Discussion on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) and Relevant Regulations



Under section 33 of the regulatory policy, certain categories may be allowed an Additional Floor Space Index (FSI), especially under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).



In accordance with section 7.1 of the regulation, all reservations in the Development Plan (DP) are to be fully developed. The provision for additional amenities and facilities are stipulated in Annexure ‘A’ to this Regulation. The relocation of reservations, in order to mitigate sector planning issues, may be sanctioned with special permission from the CEO/OSD(DRP) of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). It is important to note that the area of amenities and facilities referred to in Annexure-A includes reservations in the sanctioned DP. Significantly, the types of reservations and their area cannot be reduced under any circumstances.



Section 7.2 focuses on slums/structures slated for renewal in lands categorized under residential (R), commercial (C), or industrial (I) zones. These locations are not impacted by any other allocations/designations/reservations made in the final DP and development can proceed under certain conditions. For instance, lands under residential (R) and commercial (C) zones which are currently occupied by existing slums/structures under renewal have the authority to be developed in accordance with the regulation. In addition, lands in industrial zones (I)/Industrial estate are permitted to convert to residential usage in accordance with Regulation No. 14(B). For these lands, any pre-existing slums/structures under renewal can be developed following provisions in this Regulation.



As a special case for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), non-residential activities as described under regulation clauses no.5.3, 5.6, and regulation nos. 4 & 7 of 33(9)(A) are allowed to be developed without the need for a zone change.



Moving to section 7.3, it deals with slums/structures under renewal located on lands designated for non-buildable reservations such as playgrounds, gardens, parks, or other open uses in the Final DP. These areas, currently occupied by existing slums/structures under renewal, are required to be relocated within the same planning sector. This strategy ensures that the sites occupied by these establishments are available for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) implementation, as per the DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)) or the concerned government authority's specifications. In turn, these areas are handed over to the SRA or the concerned government authority free of all costs and charges. Crucially, the land area under such reservation becomes part of the project plot area and can be considered for Floor Space Index (FSI) purposes.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Specific Categories in Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Subsection 33(10)(A): Granting additional FSI for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) pertaining to DRP



In the context of [Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)](/33/10/A), slums or structures up for renewal on lands reserved or designated for existing or prospective public services are expected to be relocated within the same planning sector. Such areas that are cleared for the implementation of DRP will accede to the designated amenities under the project as per the specifications by DRP/SRA or the respective government authority.



This developed amenity will be transferred, without any charges, to the DRP/SRA or the relevant Government authority. However, the Built-Up Area (BUA) of such an amenity will be disregarded for the computation of FSI. Post this, the full permissible FSI of the plot will be considered into the project area for FSI calculations.



In case of buildable reservations on slum lands not covered under clause 7.4(a), 25 percent of the reservation area will be required by the SRA at no expense for the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) or other fitting authorities. The BUA of the said amenity will be excluded from the FSI computation.



Where the development plan road or proposed road is within the DRP area, the full 100 percent FSI of the road may be allocated on the same plot. It's notable that the development of slum plots under DCR 33(10)(A) and urban renewal plots under DCR 33(9)(A) may be combined to facilitate design flexibility and increased resources.



In the case of DRP sites located alongside railway tracks, a boundary wall of at least 2.4 meters is stipulated to be erected. Lastly, slums or structures on lands designated for rehabilitation and resettlement will be reckoned as sites for slum redevelopment, and their redevelopment will be governed by this regulation.


# Enhanced Details on the Permitting of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Specific Categories



This section investigates the regulation 33(10)(A), which attends to the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRS) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) in the context of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP). The primary focus is on permitting options for specific categories to allow additional Floor Space Index (FSI).



One essential point under this regulation is the relocation and redevelopment of existing slums that are based in perilous locations. Slum areas situated on marshy lands, alongside water bodies, neighboring railway tracks or within railway lands, the No Development Zones (NDZ), and sites that are extremely needed for public or semi-public projects are highlighted in the context.



These defined unsafe slum locations may be transferred to other safer and suitable locations within the planning sectors. Furthermore, these relocated sectors are allowed to be developed following the guidelines of this regulation specifically for the additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


#  Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permissions for Specific Categories Under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA), Particularly within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## 33(10)(A)- Proposed Amenities for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme within Dharavi Notified Area



In Dharavi Redevelopment Project, multiple facilities such as Balwadi, a Welfare hall, a health Centre/ outpost, Aaganwadi, skill development centre, women entrepreneurship centre, yuvakendra / library, are required to be provided. Each of these amenity centres should occupy a 25-square-meter area to accommodate 250 or part of 250 hutment dwellers.



When misuse occurs, the management of these facilities might be transferred to the DRP, which has the authority to reassign it to another organization or institution for public use. 



In every Co-operative housing society, an office built under D.C. Regulations No. 37(9) is expected for each 100 rehab tenement. More society offices should be constructed for each succeeding 100 rehab tenements. 



A community hall is required as part of the project's rehabilitation component. The area of this hall should be 2% of the rehabilitation built up area of all the buildings or 200 sq. m, whichever is less. 



## Existing Religious and Social Structures under Dharavi Redevelopment Project



Existing religious structures are permitted to continue under the redevelopment scheme but they must not exceed the area they occupied prior to redevelopment. Other social infrastructure including School, Dispensary, and Gymnasium run by public authority or charitable trust can also continue to operate without an increase in their existing area. 



For projects with less than 250 hutments, certain amenities such as Balwadi, Welfare hall, and two others, along with an office for the Co-operative housing society are mandatory, as per D.C. Regulations No. 37(9). 



## Distribution and Importance of Amenities in Dharavi Redevelopment Project



Facilities including Aaganwadi, health centre / outpost, community hall/gymnasium / fitness centre, skill development centre, women entrepreneurship centre, yuvakendra / library community hall/s, society office, balwadi/s, religious structure/s, and social infrastructures like School, Dispensary, Gymnasium run by Public Authority or Charitable Trust, will be offered at no cost and will form part of the rehabilitation component. Computation of the free-sale component is based on this component.



## Provision for Construction of Transit Camps under Dharavi Redevelopment Project



All mentioned provisions under the DRP are also applicable to the construction of transit camps under DC Regulations 33(11).





# Detailed Analysis of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Certain Categories


This segment explores the specifications and allowances of the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for particular categories, specifically within the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).



- In the context of the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) taking place within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), Aaganwadi will not be included in calculating the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


- The Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP) will not account for health centres or outposts.


- Community halls, gymnasiums or fitness centres that exist within the proposed Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) are not counted towards the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


- Skill development centres are excluded from the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) measurements within the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) in the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).


- Women entrepreneurship centres, yuvakendra or libraries, present within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA), will not be factored into the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


- Society offices, Balwadis, and religious structures within the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme in the Dharavi Notified Area, will not be considered in the calculation of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


- Social infrastructure such as schools, dispensaries and gymnasiums, managed by either public authority or charitable trusts in the rehabilitation component, are not taken into account while computing the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within the Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP).


# Detailed Overview of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) allocation and restrictions for Slum Rehabilitation Schemes within Dharavi Notified Area



For the **Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA)** within the **Dharavi Notified Area (DNA)** pertaining to the Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP), there are critical financial contributions to be made by the developers. 



- Developers are required to deposit Rs 40000 per tenement or such amount as might be decided by the Government periodically into a corpus fund to be managed by the SRA for DRP. This allocation serves as maintenance funding for the cooperative housing society of the rehab residents. The payment of this deposit must align with the schedule stipulated by the Office of Special Duties (OSD) for DRP, which is a part of the Slum Rehabilitation Authority.



- By the construction completion phase of the project, it is compulsory that the total amount, calculated at the rate of Rs 40000 per completed tenement, have been fully deposited. The building permission for the last quarter of the free sale component will be granted only after the satisfactory fulfillment of this requirement.



Additionally, developers have an obligation for a designated per square meter payment based on the built-up area (BUA) exceeding the ordinarily permissible floor space index (FSI). This rate is currently Rs 840 or a potentially different amount as decided by the Government at varying times. The payments go directly to the SRA as per a schedule put in place by the OSD for DRP, given that these payments do not extend beyond the project's construction completion date. These infrastructural charges are supplemental to the development charges incurred under section 124 of MR&TP Act 1966. 



Please note that the funds collected as infrastructural charges remain with the DRP and the SRA and are exclusively designated for infrastructural improvement schemes within the DRP areas. 



Lastly, any part of the land premium that the Government of Maharashtra eventually makes available to the landowning authority will be used solely for infrastructural improvement schemes within the Dharavi Redevelopment Project.

There are no amenities that the developers are mandated to construct in Sectors I, IV, or V based on the information shared above.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted for Specific Categories within Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



## Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA) within Dharavi Notified Area (DNA) for Dharavi Redevelopment Project (DRP)



In the first SR. No.16, the amenity being provided under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project is a parking lot (RT1.6). This will not be provided in Sectors I to IV, but a 1.28 hectare space will be allocated in Sector V, resulting in a total of 1.28 hectares.



In SR. No.17, public open spaces that may serve mixed purposes are being planned. These will span 1.58 hectares in Sector I, III, IV, and V, but none in Sector II, making the total area to be 6.32 hectares.



For SR. No.18, the layout RG to be provided in sale and rehab areas for multi-use will cover 0.77 hectares in Sector I, 1.39 hectares in Sector II, 1.15 hectares in Sector III, 1.06 hectares in Sector IV, and 0.43 hectares in Sector V, totaling 4.81 hectares.



For SR. No.19, playgrounds attached to schools, possibly serving mixed purposes, will encompass 0.40 hectares in Sector I, 0.73 hectares in Sector II, 0.60 hectares in Sector III, 0.55 hectares in Sector IV, and 0.23 hectares in Sector V, an overall span of 2.50 hectares.

Lastly, in SR. No.22, an area of 0.40 hectares of land will be given to the TATA Power Electric Co. in Sector II. 



Please note that all additional facilities within the DNA will be treated as DP Proposals, including roads with a width of 12 meters and above. 



The SRA reserves the right to modify the categories of the additional amenities in accordance with the approval of the Government of Maharashtra.



Note:



The development of land will adhere to the provisions of the DC Rules for Greater Mumbai and relevant sections of the MA & TP Act, 1966. MCGM and Municipal Commissioner will be replaced by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and OSD, DRP (Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA)) respectively.





#  Detailed Information on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) and Provisions for Permanent Transit Camp Tenements in Slum Rehabilitation Scheme 33(11)



This section provides insights into the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that can be permitted for certain categories, focusing on the provisions concerning Permanent Transit Camp tenements under the Slum Rehabilitation Scheme (SRA). The total FSI on the plot area could be propelled to a maximum of 4 for the construction of Transit Camp tenements for the Slum Rehabilitation Authority.



##  Regulations and Distribution of Additional FSI for Transit Camp Construction



The structure and allocation of the additional FSI geared towards constructing Transit Camp Tenements or Rental Housing have been outlined in the following table:



- In the Island City, for locations with a road width ranging from 12m to 18m, a total permissible FSI of 3.0 may be allowed, having a basic zonal FSI of 1.33 and an additional FSI of up to 1.67. Here, 63% of the total additional FSI can be utilized for Transit tenements designated for Slum Rehabilitation Authority, and 37% can be used for the sale component.



- Similarly, within the Island City, for areas with a road width greater than 18m, a total permissible FSI up to 4.0 can be sanctioned, entailing a zonal FSI of 1.33 and an additional FSI of 2.67. The division of this additional FSI maintains that 63% can be designated for SRA Transit tenements, and 37% for the sale portion.



- For the Suburbs and Extended Suburbs, locations featuring a 12m to 18m road width can get a total permissible FSI up to 3.0, incorporating a basic zonal FSI of 1.00 and an additional FSI of up to 2.00. In this context, equal proportions, i.e., 50% of the total additional FSI, can be allowed for constructing SRA Transit tenements and the sale component respectively.



- Identically, in the Suburbs and Extended Suburbs, regions with a road width exceeding 18m may receive a total permissible FSI of up to 4.0, with a zonal FSI of 1.00 and an additional FSI of up to 3.00. The utilization of this extra FSI is equally divided, assigning 50% for SRA Transit tenements and 50% for the selling segment.



Worthy of note is that such calculations consider the plot area excluding land pledged to the Mumbai City Corporation or appropriate authorities as part of Reservation/Existing amenity under the Mumbai Metropolitan City Act.



##  Restrictions and Specifications for Transit Tenement Construction



However, these provisions are impermissible on lands previously reserved for existing amenities under the Development Plan (DP) or in Scheduled Development Zones (SDZ)/Green Zones (GZ). Another considerable factor is that the additional FSI granted for SRA Transit construction can be employed for creating Transit Camp of tenements which have a carpet area of about 27.88 sqm (300 sq.ft.).



The ground floor of these constructed tenements can be used for commercial tenements, having an approximate carpet area of 20.90 sq. m (225 sq. ft.), which will be designated for project-affected commercial tenements. The resultant buildings will be handed over free of charge to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority. There's an alternate provision allowing residential tenements to be repurposed for Government Staff Quarters.



## Regulations on Built-up Area and Arrangement of Basic Facilities



According to this regulation, the Built-up Area (BUA) will align with clause 3.2 of Regulation 33(10). Also, the provision of basic facilities, such as Aaganwadi, Health Centre/Outpost, Community Hall/Gymnasium/Fitness Centre, Skill Development Centre, Women Entrepreneurship Centre, Yuva Kendra/Library, Society Office, Balwadi, will be as specified under sub-regulation 8 of regulation 33(10) for these transit camps. Moreover, 25% of the Zonal (basic) FSI will be reserved explicitly for the construction of shops along layout roads, ensuring residential occupants of the layout can utilize them.


#  Provisioning Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Certain Categories: Extensions Pertaining to Permanent Transit Camp Tenements for Slum Rehabilitation Scheme



_Base FSI and Additional FSI for Permanent Transit Camp Tenements in Slum Rehabilitation Scheme_



Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) surpassing the basic Zonal FSI may be granted, corresponding to the Built-Up Area (BUA) of free-of-cost tenements handed over to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) or Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) depending on the situation. In situations where there's an unconsumed sale component of additional FSI, Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) could be permitted instead. This regulation considers the SRA as the Planning Authority for Permanent Transit Camp (PTC) allotments.



_Calculation of BUA, Occupation Certificates, and Prohibited Case for Zonal FSI_



The measurement of the PTC tenements' BUA complies with clause 3.2 of Regulation 33(10). Authorization such as Occupation Certificate and utility connections for other unaffected parts will only proceed after the handover of Transit Camps to the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA). This regulation forbears plots where the admissible Zonal F.S.I is less than 1.00.



_PTC Components Recategorization and Clubbing Provisions_



The entire Permanent Transit Camp components, including Base FSI, may be recategorized as permanent transit components where applicable. Sale components from the additional FSI among schemes under this regulation can be interchanged. Clubbing provisions permit developers to collectively apply for more than one plot owned by single or multiple owners. This is permissible only if it results in an independent plot or building or wing, with the PTC component being transferred to the Planning Authority.



_Unearned Income and Clubbing Boundaries_



As an unearned income, developers are to pay 40% of the difference of sale value of shifted built up area of PTC component, valued as per ASR/READY RECKONER. Clubbing of schemes occurs within the same ward or neighboring wards or within a range of 5 km.



_Premium Payment and Car Parking_ 



Premiums are paid to the Planning Authority in two stages: 50% during the issue of Initial Offer Agreement (IOA) and the remaining 50% when issuing the Construction Certificate (C.C.) for the incentive FSI. Alternatively, the developer can surrender an equivalent sale FSI in lieu of a constructed BUA to the extent of premium, based on ASR/READY RECKONER valuing. For PTC tenements, irrespective of other regulations, a combination of car parking at rates specified in Regulation 44 Table-21 and one parking space per tenement for two-wheelers is provided.



_Utilization of Premium Collected_



Note: Two-thirds of the total collected premium under these regulations will be set aside in a distinct account, designated as a shelter fund for the State of Maharashtra. The remaining one-third will be allocated to the Office of the Deputy Director of Town Planning, Greater Mumbai.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Certain Specific Categories in Redevelopment of Contravening Structures 



## 33(12)(A) - Redevelopment of contravening structures included in the Final Plot of a TP Scheme



When it comes to the redevelopment or reconstruction of contravening structures in TP Schemes, there are specific regulations that permit the allowance of an additional FSI beyond what is typically permissible. 



Primarily, in the course of the redevelopment scheme, tenants documented in the TP Scheme Book, residing in contravening structures, must be accommodated by offering alternative housing options within the same scheme or administrative ward. Each alternative accommodation unit should boast a carpet area equivalent to 27.88 sqm or 300 sq.ft, regardless of their original holding. However, the overall FSI consumption of the Final Plot must not exceed a limit of 4.0.



In the redevelopment scheme, commercial users can also be accommodated for the benefit of existing commercial tenants, as long as the commercial area within the redevelopment scheme does not surpass the original commercial area. 



Furthermore, tenants not enlisted in the records of the TP Scheme but residing within the contravening structure can also be included in the Redevelopment Scheme. The inclusion as tenants applies to individuals living in structures that have surfaced post the finalization of the TP Scheme. These residents, appearing in the Legislative Assembly Voter’s List published periodically by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM), and whose names are in line with the residences, are eligible to be integrated into the redevelopment scheme. 



Their accommodation should measure 27.88 sq. m. for residential and mixed commercial-residential occupants. For commercial occupants, the existing area or 20.90 sq.m, whichever is less should be provided, as long as the total FSI of the plot stays within 4.0. 



Moreover, a BUA equivalent to the tenant area or 27.88 sq. m, whichever is lesser, has to be handed over free of cost to the particular tenant by the Developer or Owner. The cost for any additional BUA is subject to a mutually agreeable amount shared between the tenant and owner. 



For the purpose of this redevelopment scheme, the owner or developer can obtain an additional FSI up to 50% of the area of the subjected structures, provided that the overall FSI of the Final Plot does not exceed 4.0. 



The Fungible Area (FCA) can be utilized for the rehab components for the tenants listed in the TP Scheme Book, living in the contravening structures. This usage is allowed without charging a premium for the fungible area and to the incentivized BUA by charging a premium.



The contravening structures, in this context, refer to:


1. Structures outside the original plot but fully or partially enclosed within the final plot entrusted to a person in the TP Scheme.


2. Structures that are included in the final plot granted to a person, and/or structures included in the roads, sites preserved for public purpose, or adjacent to the final plot.


# Comprehensive Overview on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permissible for Certain Categories



When considering the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that may be permitted for specific categories, some crucial factors come into play. Under clause 33(12)(A), one provision allows for the redevelopment of structures that contradict existing regulations and are included in the Final Plot of a Town Planning (TP) Scheme. 



In terms of structures which are part of the TP Scheme region, but are located outside a person's allocated final plot, they may become subject to redevelopment if they are affected by sites reserved for public use. This allowance, however, is only applicable if the Planning Authority does not have any objections towards the rehabilitation of these structures.



However, a distinction is made when considering structures present in the common area comprising original plots and final plots. By standards, these structures should not be identified and treated as the ones that are contravening any established structures. 



Thus, in context to the Flexible Space Index (FSI) regulations, redevelopment permission varies significantly, taking into account the nature of the structures and the potential effects of their redevelopment on the surrounding public sites.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Certain Categories: A Deeper Understanding of Regulation 33(12)(B)

## 33(12)(B) - Removal and re-accommodation of tolerated /protected structures falling in the alignment of road

In a scheme where the removal and re-accommodation of tolerated or protected structures that fall in the alignment of existing roads, or road widening that has a prescribed road line or Development Plan (DP) Road, has been proposed within the same administrative ward, the allowable Floor Space Index (FSI) may exceed the permissible FSI. This excess is subject to certain conditions detailed below:



- The tolerated residential structures must have existed since or before 17.04.1964, and non-residential structures should have existed since or before 01.04.1962. These structures should fall in the alignment of the existing road or any road widening with a prescribed road line or DP Road.


- These structures should be reflected in the true extract of Revenue Record recorded before 1961-62 or in the prior assessment records.


- The scheme plot and the tolerated structures mentioned must be relocated in the same administrative ward. 


- The regulations given will not be applicable to the structures where development is proposed or is in progress within the plot where these protected structures are located. 


- It will be the responsibility of owners or developers seeking benefit under this regulation to execute a registered agreement with the plot owner housing these structures, the occupants of these structures, and the authorities about their removal. This agreement must be submitted to MCGM.


- The owner or developer must also provide an advance possession receipt to MCGM for the takeover of the plot affected by road line or DP road.


- The plot owner will be eligible for Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) according to the Zonal (basic) FSI of the plot. The TDR will be issued once the ownership of the land has been transferred to MCGM.


- The Assistant Commissioner of the respective ward and MHADA (in the case of cessed structures) will verify the existence of structures, carpet area, and occupancy of the eligible occupants.


- In scenarios where an area occupied by cessed structures is affected by road widening or DP Road, a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from MHADA will be required.


- Eligible occupants of tolerated structures are entitled to a minimum carpet area of 27.88 sq. m, or an area equivalent to the existing carpet area. Non-residential tenant/occupants will be allocated an area equal to the existing carpet area.


# Detailed Overview on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permissions for Specific Categories



## Rules Concerning the Removal and Re-Accommodation of Tolerated/Protected Structures in Road Alignment



The regulations dictate that the scheme owner may qualify for the Built-Up Area (BUA) necessary for rehousing current tenants or occupants, in addition to an incentive BUA equivalent to 50% of the BUA needed for rehabilitation. Despite this, it is essential to note that the FSI on the plot or layout should not exceed up to 4.0.



When a portion of structures aligns with the road, the occupants of such structures will also be eligible for the aforementioned benefits. Furthermore, the owner could also gain Transferable Development Rights (TDR) equivalent to the Zonal (basic) FSI of the land given up.



As per the rules, the owner can only receive the commencement certificate for the incentive BUA post-rehabilitation of the occupants of the tolerated structures affected or the removal of structures within the road line/DP Road alignment.



Furthermore, the regulations also state that Fungible Area, or Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA), is allowed for rehabilitation without premium charges, and for the incentive BUA, with premium charges.



Finally, protected structures that fall within the Road/DP road alignment, as certified by a competent authority and announced by the government periodically, are also eligible for rehabilitation under these regulations. The condition here is that the rehabilitation area should be 27.88 sq. m for residential or mixed-use occupants. For commercial occupants, it should be either their current area or 20.90 sq. m, whichever is less.


# 33. Parameters and Conditions for Granting Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) to Information Technology Establishments



## 33(13) - Allowance for Extra FSI in IT(Information Technology) Buildings



Upon securing special permission, the Commissioner can authorize the floor space indices (FSI) to exceed beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI specified under Regulation No. 30 Table No. 12 to accommodate registered Public & Private IT/ITES Parks, AVGC Parks, IT SEZs, IT Parks within SEZs, or Stand-alone IT/ITES units in public IT Park. This also includes IT/ITES units located in residential, commercial, and industrial zones where such activities are permissible and have been sanctioned by the Directorate of Industries. This provision applies to both proposed and already established units under current or previous IT/ITES policies, with the condition of levying a premium mentioned below.



##### Maximum Permissible FSI Based on Road Width for Buildings of Information Technology Establishments



In the case of IT Buildings located on a road wider than 12 meters, a maximum FSI of up to 3 may be granted. IT Buildings on roads wider than 18 meters may be granted an FSI of up to 4, while those on roads wider than 27 meters can have an FSI of up to 5. These inferences have been drawn excluding the plot area needed to be handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority as a replacement of Reservation/ Existing amenity in the DP/ proposed DP roads/prescribed RL under MMC Act.



The additional FSI is subject to few conditions:



1. The additional FSI can be granted exceeding the permissible FSI under regulation 30(A)(1) upon paying a premium. This premium, calculated for the built-up area (BUA), is pegged at 50% of ASR/READY RECKONER for open develop land (for FSI 1).



2. The collected premium will be halved vetween the Planning Authority and the Government. The government's share should be paid to the Deputy Director of Town Planning, Greater Mumbai.



3. The premium charges will be based on the value of lands in the specific zones as mentioned in the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR/READY RECKONER), payable when permitting the additional FSI.



4. Maximum 20% of the total proposed built-up area (excluding parking area), including the additional FSI, can be utilized for support services as defined in the IT/ITES Policy 2015, within IT Parks. The remaining space should be employed for IT/ITES purposes.



5. Maximum 40% of the total proposed built-up area (excluding parking area), along with additional FSI, may be allocated for support services in IT Parks in Municipal Corporations not under Serial No. c), with the remaining area reserved for IT/ITES.



6. Every new unit should allocate at least 2% of the total proposed built-up area to incubation facilities for new units. This area will be considered as part of the Park to be used for IT activities and eligible for additional FSI benefits.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance and Regulations for Information Technology Establishments



### Subsection 33(13): Critical Infrastructure Fund for IT/ITES Industries


The planning authority will receive a premium as defined by this regulation for buildings of Information Technology Establishments. Payments must be deposited into a dedicated fund, known as the Critical Infrastructure Fund for IT/ITES Industries. The purpose of this fund is strictly for the creation of critical infrastructures specific to IT/ITES industries.



Further provisions state that in scenarios where developers offer to provide off-site infrastructure at their own cost instead of paying the premium, the planning authority has the discretion to determine the estimated work cost. This determination considers the District Schedule of Rates (DSR) of the relevant year. The planning authority sets the standard for the work. Upon completion, the planning authority must validate the development against the set guidelines. Then, subtracting the infrastructural development cost from the premium amount, the balance is remitted by the developer before the issuance of an Occupancy Certificate.



Extra provisions dictate that if the cost of work exceeds the derivative premium, the developer bears the extra cost.



### Subsection 33(13): Development Permissions for IT/ITES Industries


The Aviation Department governs the maximum allowable height for erecting towers and antennas. The respective commissioner grants these permissions following the established protocol or as decided by the government. 



While developing an IT/ITES site with additional FSI, support services, as defined in the IT Policy 2015, are permitted. Despite these regulations, it's not necessary to leave any amenity space for developments on plots or land up to 2.00 Ha for IT/ITES.



The Directorate of industries develops a web portal where developers of each IT park need to provide and update comprehensive information. This includes a list of units in the park, details on the built-up area's utilization, kinds of activities taking place, and yearly statistics of manpower employed in the park under IT/ITES and support services.



### Subsection 33(13): Regulations for Private IT Parks


Penalties are enacted if it's found that a private IT park, having utilised the additional FSI provisions of the IT/ITES policy, uses the built-up space for non-IT/ITES or commercial activities or any unapproved activities. The ratio of penalty payments shared between the Planning Authority and the Government is 3:1.



The detection of misuse is done through physical site verification by a team comprised of Directorate of Industries and Planning Authority officers that approved the building's plans from the respective private IT park. The penalty corresponds to 0.3% of the prevailing ready reckoner value of the built-up space found to be used for non-IT/ITES activities. The penalty is calculated from the commencement date of the unauthorized use, and it continues until the misuse stops.


# Enhanced Measurement Methodology for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Specific Categories



As part of our consideration for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in certain categories, we examine the particular scenario of Buildings of Information Technology Establishments. This is under Section 33(13) of our guidelines.



The regulations stipulate that buildings belonging to Information Technology Establishments need to pay a penalty to the respective Planning Authority that sanctioned the building plans of the associated private IT park. Upon remitting this penalty, such private IT park should reinstate the premises' usage to the initial purpose for which Letter of Intent (LOI)/Registration had been granted.



Failure of the private IT Parks to pay this penalty and/or restore the premises to its original intended use will lead to the relevant Planning Authority taking appropriate action. This action will be in alignment with the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966, working against the non-compliant private IT Park. The Planning Authority will also intimate the Directorate of Industries about these developments.



It is important to clarify that these provisions apply not just to prospective IT Parks but also to existing ones. Moreover, these provisions are to be understood as being additional to the penal provisions of the MRTP Act.1966. This means that non-compliance can trigger penalties from the MRTP Act.1966 in addition to those specified under our guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI).


# Detailed Regulations for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted for Smart Fin Tech Centre Buildings- 33(13)(A)



### Conditions for Allowing Additional FSI for Smart Fin Tech Centre Buildings



1. According to the rule 33(13)(A), buildings of Smart Fin Tech Centre, whether located in Residential/Industrial/Commercial Zones and approved by the Directorate of Information Technology, may receive additional FSI up to 200% over the basic permissible F.S.I if sanctioned by the Commissioner. This allowance is given on condition that 40% premium of the prescribed land rate for that year is charged. However, this additional FSI can only be granted to plots with an access road that is at least 18 meters wide and after approval by a committee chaired by the Principal Secretary of Information Technology that includes representatives of Industries, Finance, and Urban Development Department (UD-1).


   
2. The 40% premium mentioned above is shared equally between the Planning Authority and the Government, with the government's share deposited into the FinTech Corpus fund managed by the Director of Information Technology. These premium charges are determined based on the value of lands in the corresponding zones as per the Annual Statement of Rates (ASR/READY RECKONER) for the relevant year.



## Upper Limit for Permissible FSI for Smart Fin Tech Centre Buildings



1. The total maximum allowable F.S.I. should not exceed a limit of 3.00 in the suburbs, extended suburbs, and Mumbai City. Nonetheless, for plots spanning 2,00,000 sq. mtr. or more and fronting roads of 24.00 m in width or more, the F.S.I. limit may be raised to 4.00. 



## Exceptions and Specificities for Smart Fin Tech Centre Buildings



1. It should be noted that, according to these regulations, no amenity space needs to be left undeveloped for Smart Fin Tech Centre plots/land up to 2.00 Hectare. 


  
2. A minimum requirement is that at least 85% of the total proposed built-up area (excluding parking area) should be dedicated for FinTech business related activities (start-ups, incubators, accelerators), and banking, financial services including NBFC and insurance, and IT/ITES with focus on FinTech.



3. As per the implemented policies, the Directorate of Information Technology is obliged to develop a web portal where developers of each Smart FinTech Centre must regularly provide and update information about names of the units in the park, utilization of built-up space, activities carried out, and employment statistics in the Smart FinTech Centre on a yearly basis.


# Enhanced Regulations for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Certain Categories: Case of Smart Fin Tech Centres



## Case 33(13)(A) - Rules and Penalties for Misuse of Additional FSI in Smart Fin Tech Centres



In the scenario where a Smart Fin Tech Centre has leveraged additional Floor Space Index (FSI) under Smart Fin Tech Centre policy provisions, if it happens that the built space is being exploited for purposes not related to FinTech or for commercial activities disallowed under the Smart FinTech Centre policy, punitive actions will be enforced.



If misuse of the Smart FinTech Centre's space is confirmed via physical site evaluation conducted by teamed officials from the Directorate of Information Technology and MCGM, which had earlier sanctioned the building plans of the said Smart Fin Tech Centre, a daily penalty of 0.3% of the prevailing ready reckoner value of the non-FinTech occupied area will be enacted.



The penalty is imposed from the beginning date of unauthorized practice until the cessation of non-FinTech operations. The financial penalty's distribution will be shared between the MCGM and the Government, maintaining a ratio division of 3:1.



Post paying the penalty to MCGM, the concerned Smart FinTech Centre should restore premises use to its original intended purpose for which it was initially granted LOI/Registration. Failure to comply with the penalty payment or restoration to the initial intended use will prompt MCGM to undertake necessary actions under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act of 1966 against the non-compliant Smart FinTech Centre.



In addition, these aforementioned provisions will supplement penal provisions of the MRTP Act 1966.



## Clarification of Terms in Regulation 33(13)(A)



According to this regulatory clause, terms and expressions hold the meanings specified in the FinTech Policy pronounced by the Directorate of Information Technology in the Government Resolution No. DIT-2018/CR-17/D-1/39 dated 16th February 2018. Independent of any content in the existing regulation, these mentioned provisions will apply to Smart Fin Tech Centres. The other sections of existing regulations that have not been explicitly covered in this specific rule will remain applicable.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowance for Specific Categories: Shifting of Cattle Sheds Outside Greater Mumbai- 33(14)



For lands that become vacant due to the shifting of existing cattle sheds to locations outside Greater Mumbai, an additional 33% Floor Space Index (FSI) over the basic Zonal permissible FSI is granted. This applies specifically to the lands that were previously occupied by authorized or tolerated cattle sheds which were standing before the date of 01/04/1962 in the Suburbs and extended Suburbs of Greater Mumbai.



The regulations of developing these vacant lands previously occupied by the shifted cattle sheds will comply with the zoning Regulations of their respective zones. Furthermore, the exact additional FSI will be calculated and regulated case by case, by a specifically constituted committee in the Urban Development Department.



The committee comprises of the following members:



1. The Chief Engineer (D.P) from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, Mumbai, serves as the Chairman.


2. Representing the ADF Department, the Cattle Controller from Mumbai, is a Member.


3. A notable member is The Deputy Director of Town Planning from Greater Mumbai, Mumbai.


4. The Superintendent of Land Records, from Mumbai Suburban District, Mumbai, is also a member.



The proposed development is also subject to any additional conditions that the committee may prescribe. Payment of a premium amount as decided by the Government in the Urban Development Department is also required for all additional FSI's allowed.


# Enhanced Regulations for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Certain Categories



## Deliberations on Development of Land for MHADA/Mill Workers Housing under Regulation No. 33(15)



In the context of lands dedicated to the development for transit camp/mill workers housing orchestrated by the MHADA, an FSI up to 4.0, inclusive of Zonal (basic) FSI, is permissible on those lands specifically reserved for MHADA/Mill Workers Housing in accordance with Regulation No. 35, provided certain conditions are adhered to. 



It is mandated that the development of land that has been marked for the use of mill workers must be solely dedicated to housing for mill workers. Additionally, any land assigned for MHADA for public housing must utilize at least 100% of the granted FSI specifically for mill workers housing. The remaining FSI can be used exclusively for the creation of a transit camp. 



## Relaxations in Building Standards and Other Requirements



The computation of the permissible FSI must be performed on the gross plot area. There is provision to permit recreational open spaces that go up to 8% of the total area. Similarly, the regulation demands that open space requirements should align with the prescriptions outlined in Regulation No. 41(5).


# Detailed Explanation on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowed for Certain Categories in Gaothan/ Koliwada/Adiwasi Pada Area



##  33(16) - Reconstruction/Redevelopment in Gaothan/ Koliwada/Adiwasi pada area 



The allowed floor space index (FSI) for the reconstruction or redevelopment of any property in the Gaothan, Koliwada, or Adiwasipada areas that are on the 'A' land tenure is discussed in this section.



- In the case of plots that front on roads with a width of less than 9 meters but more than 6.0 meters, the permissible FSI will be 1.5. 


- An additional FSI of 0.5 can be allowed for commercial use on plots that front on roads with a width of 9 meters or more, either existing or proposed. This is, however, subject to the condition that the required margin and parking space as per these regulations are provided. 


- The consumed FSI of existing buildings, which are utilized with authorization, shall be permitted for both cases mentioned above. 



The boundaries of the Gaothan, Koliwada, or Adiwasipada areas as finalized by the Revenue Department shall reflect as the boundaries of these areas on the Development Plan. The government may make an independent provision for the development of Gaothan, Koliwada, or Adiwasipada areas.


# Detailed Information on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Permitted for Certain Categories: Emphasis on Buildings of Biotechnology Establishments- 33(17)



Paragraph 33 in the regulation document specifies the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that could be granted to certain categories. It further expounds on the Floor Space Index concessions provided under provision 33(17) for Buildings of Biotechnology Establishments.



With special permission, the Commissioner may authorize a FSI beyond the primordial zonal (basic) FSI stated in Regulation No. 30 Table No. 12. This concession exclusively applies to buildings in independent plots dedicated to the development of Biotechnology units. Such units must be established by Public Bodies, such as MHADA, SEEPZ, MIDC, SICOM, CIDCO, or their joint venture companies. To be eligible, these joint venture companies must hold more than an 11% stake of these bodies, or their lessees.



## Maximum Permissible FSI for Buildings of Biotechnology Establishments Based on Road Width 



* The building with a road width more than 12 meters could have a maximum permissible FSI of up to 3.


* For buildings in locations with a road width greater than 18 meters, a maximum permissible FSI of up to 4 may be granted.


* Buildings situated near roads wider than 27 meters can be allotted a maximum permissible FSI of up to 5.  



Please note that the above values are calculated based on the plot area, excluding any territory handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority in lieu of Reservation/ Existing amenity in the DP/ proposed DP roads/prescribed RL under MMC Act.



The Commissioner holds the right to specify the terms and conditions. Provided that in the situations of granting additional FSI for Biotechnology units, a premium equating to 50% of ASR/READY RECKONER for open develop land (for FSI 1) or as determined by the Government shall be given to MCGM. From this amount, 50% shall be payable to the Government.


# 33. Additional Floor Space Index (FSI): Eligibility and Permissions for Development of Multi Storey Public Parking Lots (PPL)- 33(18)



The **Additional Floor Space Index (FSI)** may be granted to certain categories. One such category pertains to **development of Multi Storey Public Parking Lots (PPL)**. This development must occur on a plot adjoining a road with a minimum width of 18 meters. 



Additional FSI, also referred to as Incentive FSI, may be allotted based on the built-up parking area which is constructed and provided to the MCGM, Mumbai's municipal corporation, at no charge. This provision is applicable to lands privately owned or leased government and MCGM plots with prior agreement, given that they are not reserved for any public function. This incentive is subject to certain conditions. 



The plot on which this development occurs should cover a minimum area of 1000 square meters. It should, at a minimum, provide 50 public parking spaces for motor vehicles, equivalent to 700 square meters of parking space. Parking spaces can be situated in the basement, ground floor, or upper floors. Access through ramps, lifts, or a combination of both is mandatory and subject to clearance from the CFO especially highlighting fire hazards. 



Until a Parking Authority is established, a committee led by the Municipal Commissioner of MCGM is responsible for selecting plots for public parking based on suitability. 



The incentive FSI granted here is beyond the basic Zonal (FSI) permitted under any other DCPR provisions. 



###### Additional Development Rights and Obligations 



Any proposed development should comply with all other conditions set by the Municipal Commissioner. Landowners, developers, societies, and companies are not permitted to operate the public parking. Also, the area utilized for parking is not counted toward FSI consumption.



The incentive FSI offered under this scheme is 50% of the PPL's built-up area, given that the total permissible FSI, including the incentive FSI under this regulation, does not exceed the limits detailed below. 



###### Plot Areas and Corresponding Maximal Permissible FSI 



- For plots measuring up to 2000 square meters, the maximum permissible FSI is 3.00. 


- For plots larger than 2000 square meters, the maximum allowable FSI increases to 4.00.



Others specifications also apply. The height of public parking structures is limited to ground plus four levels along with three basement levels. 



###### Capping on Built-up Area (BUA) 



The maximum built-up area for each parking spot is determined by vehicle type: 



- 50 square meters for Light Motor Vehicles 


- 65 square meters for Light Commercial Vehicles 


- 120 square meters for Heavy Motor Vehicles or Buses 



The incentive FSI is calculated as per the built-up area of the PPL based on these norms or the actual built-up area of the PPL, whichever is less. Additionally, the developer of the PPL will be obliged to pay a 'premium,' calculated according to a predefined formula accounting for 60% of the value of the added built-up area corresponding to the additional FSI granted.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Application in Multi Storey Public Parking Lots (PPL) Construction



According to Article 33, certain categories might be allowed to avail Additional Floor Space Index (FSI). Section 33(18) specifies a regulation that is particularly pertaining to the Development of Multi Storey Public Parking Lots (PPL).



For an enhanced understanding:



- According to Regulation 33(18) of the Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) policies, incentive FSI for the development of Multi Storey Public Parking Lots (PPL) is determined by the sum of the cost of constructing the PPL, the cost of any additional amenities or facilities provided, and the cost of constructing Built-Up Area (BUA) corresponding to the incentive FSI admissible under the same regulation.



- To calculate the premium in line with this regulation, the cost of PPL construction, including amenities and facilities, and the cost of constructing BUA relevant to the incentive FSI, shall be considered 75% and 125% respectively of the rate of Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) construction as per ASR/READY RECKONER.



- The stipulated premium is to be paid in two phases. On one hand, 50% would be expected prior to the issuance of Intimation of Disapproval (IOD) for the PPL, while the remaining 50% will be due before the Commencement Certificate (CC) issuance for the incentive FSI permitted under this regulation.



- As mentioned in the guidelines, 100% premium payment results in the issuance of a Commencement Certificate (CC) for 50% of incentive FSI. Note that the remaining 50% Incentive FSI will not be sanctioned unless the PPL is fully completed and handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM).



- The year when the initial half of the premium is paid prior to the issuance of IOD for the PPL shall be considered as the year for determining the construction cost and for calculating the premium as per ASR/READY RECKONER. The total premium payable shall be divided equally between the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) and MCGM.



- The provisions of this regulation can potentially be applied to leasehold plots of Government and MCGM, but only with prior approval from the Government or Municipal Corporation.


# Specification of 33(19) - Additional FSI for Commercial user development in Central Business District (CBD) or plot situated in Residential or Commercial Zone or Independent plot converted in Residential or Commercial Zone from Industrial zone


In line with strategic urban planning, additional Floor Space Index (FSI) may be sanctioned under particular circumstances. This primarily targets commercial user development within Central Business Districts (CBDs), plots situated within Residential or Commercial Zones, or independent plots that have been converted into Residential or Commercial Zones from Industrial Zones.



The Commissioner has the authority to allow FSI up to a limit of 5.0, incorporating the permissible FSI as stated in Regulation 30(A)1, Table No. 12. This point applies to commercial users or developments on plots expressly labelled as CBDs or plots within Residential or Commercial Zones. These can equally pertin to independent plots converted into Residential or Commercial Zones from Industrial Zones. Allowing such FSI requires compliance with Regulation 14(B) of these Regulations. This clause is, however, underpinned by the condition that permissible FSI as detailed in Table 12 will be utilized first. Additional FSI under this section is contingent on the payment of a premium.



Additional FSI allowances are restricted to plots that are not designated or earmarked within the DP, unless affected by proposed DP roads, Sanctioned RL under the MMC Act, or parking reservations. Conversely, the development of reserved or designated plots within CBDs shall follow these Regulations’ provisions. 



A key regulation is that additional FSI in line with this clause cannot be applied for residential user development. However, 30% of the permissible FSI, under the provision of Regulation No. 30 (A)1 and Table No. 12, can be approved for residential purposes. A premium, rated at 50% of the ASR/READY RECKONER for open developed land of FSI 1, will be levied on granting extra BUA over the permissible FSI as stated per Table No. 12. This premium will be equally shared between the Government of Maharashtra (GoM), and MCGM.



It is also crucial to note the IH provision is not applicable for development within CBDs. If indeed the entire commercial development resides on a plot situated within a Commercial Zone or Independent plot in a Residential Zone, and fulfills related provisions of these Regulations, the Commissioner can sanction FSI as detailed below. This incorporates permissible FSI as per provision of Regulation 30(A)1 and Table No.12 for commercial uses. This approval is subject to the payment of a premium at a rate of 50% of the ASR/READY RECKONER for open developed land for FSI 1, to be equally divided between the Government of Maharashtra (GoM), and MCGM. Under these circumstances, no residential development will be allowed on such a plot.



## Table Representation of Maximum Permissible FSI Based on Road Width 



The following structured markdown sentences detail maximum permissible FSI from table entries grounded on minimum road width:



1. According to Sr. No 1, for roads with a width of more than 12m, the maximum permissible FSI is 3, under the provision of Additional FSI for Commercial user development in either a Central Business District (CBD) or a plot situated in Residential or Commercial Zone or Independent plot converted from an Industrial Zone.



2. In accordance to Sr. No 2, for roads wider than 18m, the maximum permissible FSI increases to 4, relevant to Additional FSI for Commercial user development in either a Central Business District (CBD) or a plot situated in Residential or Commercial Zone or Independent plot transitioned from an Industrial Zone.



3. As per Sr. No 3, for roads surpassing 27m in width, the maximum permissible FSI escalates to 5, associated with Additional FSI for Commercial user development in CBD or a plot located in Residential or Commercial Zone or Independent plot converted from an Industrial Zone.



Note: These measurements are applicable to the plot area, excluding areas that need to be handed over to the MCGM/Appropriate Authority in lieu of Reservation/Current amenity in the DP, with the exception affected by proposed DP roads issued RL under the MMC Act and Parking Reservation.


#  33(20)(A) : Development of Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R on the lands of MCGM/Government/Appropriate Authority as notified  by Government or unreserved plot of these authorities and in possessionds



Within the scope of development or redevelopment of plots specified for Affordable Housing (AH) and Rehabilitation & Resettlement (R&R) on lands within the jurisdiction of MCGM, the Government, or Relevantly Notified Appropriate Authority, specific regulations apply. These platforms also apply to unreserved plots under the stewardship of said authorities. A primary focus is established in undertaking developments for AH and R&R, specifically for housing of individuals displaced by projects initiated by the implementing agencies. These projects usually relate to Development Plan (DP), Mumbai Urban Transport Project (MUTP), Mumbai Urban Infrastructure Project (MUIP), or equally crucial public projects. The guidelines for permissible FSI are detailed below.



###### Application of Maximum Permissible FSI based on Minimum Road Width and Plot Size in Development of Affordable Housing and R&R on MCGM/Government/Appropriate-Authority Lands:


1. For a plot area up to 2000 sq. m with a road width of more than 12 m, a maximum permissible FSI of 3.00 is stipulated.


2. For plots exceeding 2000 sq. m with a road width greater than 18 m,  a maximum permissible FSI of 4.00 is designated.



Under this regulatory framework, specific conditions must be strictly observed:



- The carpet areas for tenements constructed under the concept of Affordable Housing (AH) will cater to Economically Weaker Sections (EWS), Low-Income Group (LIG), Medium-Income Group (MIG), or as otherwise decided by the Government while maintaining a minimum of 25 sq. m. However, development of tenements of other types is not permissible.


- No premium charges will be levied for a Fungible Area/Compensatory Area, including features covered under Regulation No 31(1) for developments focused on Affordable Housing (AH) and R&R tenements.


- The MCGM/Public Authority will impose an off-site infrastructure charge equal to 7% of the land rate. For areas that exceed the zonal (basic) FSI, this will be based on the Area Statement Rate/Ready Reckoner for FSI 1 for Built-Up Area (BUA).


- Open Space requirements are subject to Regulation No 41(5), taking into account any clearance from the Chief Fire Officer (CFO).


- Upon completion of AH and R&R tenement development, and subsequent granting of Occupation Certificate, the responsibility for allotment becomes the MCGM/Public Authority's role within 12 months.


- Sale proceeds of such tenements like EWS, LIG, MIG should be managed appropriately. After deducting development costs, including off-site infrastructure charges, 50% of the remaining funds will be used for implementing the Development Plan(D.P.), with the remaining amount being utilized for the development of more units of Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R tenements at other locations.


# Heading 33: Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Allowances for Specific Categories



##  33(20)(A)-  Developing Affordable Housing and Rehabilitation & Resettlement on Lands Owned by MCGM, Government, or Appropriate Authority



The provision may allow MCGM or a pertinent Public Authority to establish Affordable Housing or Rehabilitation & Resettlement on lands under their control or as specified by the Government. These lands can be either reserved lands or unreserved ones under their possession for this particular purpose. However, this permission does not extend to private landowners intending to institute similar developments.



The approved Built-Up Area (BUA) of such land can be rented out to a society consisting of the building's occupants under this arrangement.



If the development involves a layout design, it must reserve 25% of its Zonal (basic) FSI solely for the inclusion of convenience shopping venues along the layout road. This instruction serves as a directive to enhance the utility and convenience of the developed area for its residents.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) in 33(20)(B) - Development of Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R on a private plot or plot of authority other than Government/MCGM/Appropriate Authority 



This document details the potential increase in Floor Space Index (FSI) for specific categories, focusing on the non-designated, non-reserved private land development for Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R tenements. Independent property owners or authorities in certain situations may exceed the permissible FSI up to 4.0 when developing such plots for AH/R&R tenements. Ultimately, these AH/R&R tenements must be handed over to MCGM free of charge.



The distribution of this additional FSI for creating AH/R&R tenements follows a certain structure. Below are specific breakdowns of this distribution based on location, road width and additional parameters:



- In Island City with a minimum road width of 12m, the total permissible FSI is up to 3.0 with a Zonal FSI of 1.33 and an Additional FSI of up to 1.67.


- For the same location with a road width of 12m but with distribution, 63% FSI is meant for Transit tenements for Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) and 37% FSI is for the sale component of the total additional FSI.


- In Island City roads of 18m, the total permissible FSI is up to 4.0. The Zonal FSI and Additional FSI are 1.33 and up to 2.67 respectively, while the distribution of additional FSI remains the same as for 12m roads.


- In Suburbs and Extended Suburbs with a minimum road width of 12m, the total FSI is up to 3.0 with a Zonal FSI and Additional FSI of 1.00 and up to 2.00 respectively and 50% FSI is designated for the sale component of the total additional FSI.


- For these suburbs with road widths of 18m, the total permissible FSI increases to 4.0 with a Zonal FSI of 1.00 and an Additional FSI of up to 3.00, and the FSI distribution is halved.  



Please note that the plot area does not include the space to be handed over to MCGM or any analogous authority as per the Development Plan or MMC Act. 



Moreover, it is crucial to mention that this development scheme is not permissible in SDZ/GZ. The carpet areas for AH/R&R tenements shall align with the requirements of EWS, LIG and MIG as dictated by the government from time to time. This requires a minimum of 25 square meters with a Built-Up Area (BUA) to carpet area ratio of 1.2. 



The owner must declare the intent to develop the plot for AH/R&R. The additional FSI beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI correlates to the BUA of the tenements that are required to be provided free of any cost to MCGM sorted in proportion 0.50 sale: 1 AH/R&R area. The 100% sale area can only be authorized for release post entire AH/R&R handover. 



Alternatively, a Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) in lieu of the unconsumed sale component of additional FSI can also be secured. Yet, 20% of this admissible TDR shall only be released after the complete handover of the entire AH area to the MCGM.


# Additional Rule Clarifications for Allowing Extra Floor Space Index (FSI) to Certain Categories



## Details Regarding Development of Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R on Non-Government/Private Plots



Conditions applicable for the development of Affordable Housing (AH)/R&R on private or non-governmental plots are as follows:



- After the AH/R&R tenements are handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) free of cost, the Occupation Certificate for the portion available for sale shall be issued. 


- The regulations do not require the payment of a premium for the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area (FCA), and features approved without consuming the FSI as per Regulation No 31 when said development is for AH/R&R tenements. Nevertheless, the obligation to pay a premium on the owner's share persists wherever necessary.


- For Built-Up Area (BUA) beyond the Zonal (basic) FSI, there will be a mandatory 7% offsite infrastructure charge based on the land rate as specified by the Annual Schedule of Rates (ASR)/READY RECKONER for FSI 1.0.


- Permission is granted to the owner to deploy the Zonal (basic) FSI and BUA aligned with column number (7) of the table above for the uses allowed within the zone.



In context with the layout scenario:



- 25% of the Zonal (basic) FSI must be allocated exclusively for convenience shopping purposes along the layout road.


# Section 33: Provisions for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Certain Categories 



## Subsection 33(20)(B): Development of Affordable Housing (AH) and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) on Private Plots or Authority Plots Other Than Government/MCGM/Appropriate Authority

### Clubbing

The application of the provision outlined in Subsection 33(20)(B) is limited to plots where the permissible Zonal F.S.I is not less than 1.00 and a minimum road width of 12m. 



The classification of Base FSI along with the entire Affordable Housing (AH) and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) components holds applicability under this regulation. The exchange of sale components from additional FSI is permitted among multiple schemes in relation to this regulation. 



Developers are allowed to make joint applications with one or more plot owners for the development of Affordable Housing (AH) and R&R components on a single plot. This provision extends to shifting the sale component and base FSI to other plots, given the mutual agreement of all right holders of these plots. However, clubbing of plots is permissible only if it results in an independent plot, building, or wing, with the handing over of the Affordable Housing (AH) and R&R components to the Planning Authority.



The developer is required to pay as an unearned income 40% of the difference in the sale value of the shifted built-up area of Affordable Housing (AH) and Rehabilitation and Resettlement (R&R) component as per the ASR/READY RECKONER. Clubbing can be permitted for schemes within the same or adjoining ward, or within a distance of 5 km. 



The premium for the incentive FSI is payable to the Planning Authority in two stages: 50% at the time of IOA issuance, and 50% at the time of issuing C.C. Additionally, the developer may choose to surrender equivalent sale FSI in the form of the constructed built-up area (BUA) equivalent to the premium value, as valued at the ASR/READY RECKONER rate of sale for the year of surrender. 



Note: The allocated use of the total premium collected under this regulation is as follows: 2/3 for infrastructure development by MCGM and 1/3 deposited at the Office of the Deputy Director of Town Planning, Greater Mumbai.



## Subsection (C): Shramamsafaly/Ashray Yojana



Construction of tenements for the Shramsafalya/Ashrayyojana is permissible under Regulation (A) & (B) upon special permission from the Municipal Commissioner. The condition remains that the tenement sizes should comply with the requirements stipulated by such schemes.


# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Criteria for Development and Redevelopment of Municipal Markets- 33(21)(A)



This section is focused on the regulations set for the additional Floor Space Index (FSI) that may be granted for the development and redevelopment of existing Municipal Markets or reserved land for Municipal Markets owned by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM). 



MCGM's permissible FSI regulations are as follows:



- For a minimum road width of 12 meters, the maximum permissible FSI is 3.


- For a minimum road width of 18 meters, the maximum allowable FSI is 4.


- For a minimum road width of 27 meters, the maximum permissible FSI is 5.



Please note that these measurements apply to the plot area excluding the area to be transferred to the MCGM or the appropriate authority in exchange for reservation or existing amenities in the Development Plan (DP), proposed DP roads, or prescribed RL under the MMC Act.



Existing licensed vendors on these lands, if certified by the MCGM's Market Department, will be allocated spaces in the proposed redevelopment. Reallocated spaces will feature 20% more carpet area above their existing carpet area, excluding the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA). 



The built-up area (BUA) as per Zonal (basic) FSI or BUA required for the accommodation/rehabilitation of existing licensed vendors, certified by the MCGM's Market Department, will be developed exclusively for market purposes. The balance potential may be used for users permissible in the respective zone and in compliance with these regulations.



Commercial galas constructed under MCGM will be primarily allocated to existing licensed vendors certified by Market Department, followed by Project Affected Persons (PAPs) of important public purpose projects and then to new licensees based on MCGM's policy.



The MCGM has the right to undertake such developments independently. A minimum of 6 meters of open space or open spaces as required under Regulation no 41(5) will be deemed adequate, provided it meets fire safety requirements. Separate access points will be provided for the market area and other developments. Furthermore, regardless of the rules stated in this Regulation, where the existing Market/designated land has a combination of user/reservation, the existing BUA of such user must be used for such purposes.



Lastly, no premium will be charged for the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area/Fungible Area (FCA) as laid out in Regulation No 31(3).


# Detailed Guidelines on Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) for Development and Redevelopment of Public Amenities by MCGM/Government- 33(21)(B)



The following section lays out the provisions regarding the allowance of Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) applicable to certain categories, specifically 33(21)(B) - Development and Redevelopment Of Public Amenities by The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM)/Government.



The corporation or government may undertake the construction of buildings for public purposes or public amenities on their own land. The permissible FSI for the said construction is detailed in the following table.



For construction on a plot with a road width of more than 12m by MCGM or Government under section 33(21)(B), the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) is 3.



For construction on a plot with a road width of more than 18m by MCGM or Government under section 33(21)(B), the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) is 4



For construction on a plot with a road width of more than 27m by MCGM or Government under section 33(21)(B), the maximum permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) is 5.



Please note that these specifications are with respect to the plot area excluding the area to be handed over to MCGM or Appropriate Authority in lieu of Reservation, Existing amenity in the Development Plan (DP), proposed DP roads or the prescribed RL under The Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act.  



It is important to clarify that such additional FSI will not be available when any private owner undertakes the development as per Regulation No.17. Furthermore, no premium shall be charged for Fungible compensatory area as per Regulation No 31(3).





# Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Regulations for Certain Categories: Refocusing on Development and Redevelopment for Ongoing Proposals of Redevelopment of Municipal Markets- 33(21)(C)



The core theme of this section includes the redevelopment of Municipal Markets undertaken by developers, appointed by the Association of Municipal Market licensees. The document states that the ongoing proposals for redevelopment will be permitted only if an LOI or Annexure-II was previously issued and permissions were granted under the preceding market redevelopment policy. This regulation also applies to proposals with Annexure II or LOI issued prior to DCPR 2034.



Every existing licensed vendor will be rehabilitated within the smallest existent carpet area, as certified by the Market Department of MCGM. The Built-up area (BUA) according to Zonal (basic) FSI or BUA deemed necessary for the accommodation or the rehabilitation of the current licensed vendors, whichever is larger, will be devoted exclusively to market purposes, and the remaining potential may be used for users allowable in the respective zones.



Additionally, the permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) has been outlined according to the following parameters:



- For 33(21)(C) - Development and Redevelopment for ongoing proposals of redevelopment of Municipal Markets undertaken by the Developers appointed by Association of Municipal market licensees’, a road width of more than 12m and less than 18m, garners a Maximum permissible FSI of 3.


- For the same proposal but with a road width of more than 18m and less than 27m, the Maximum permissible FSI is 4.


- Lastly, if the road width exceeds 27m, the Maximum permissible FSI is 5.



The plot area that is obtained post-exclusion of spaces surrendered to the MCGM/Appropriate Authority in lieu of Reservation/Existing amenity in the DP/proposed DP roads/prescribed RL under MMC


Act must offer separate access for the Market area and any other development proposed.



Moreover, the incentive FSI and sharing of remaining BUA between the MCGM & private entity or developers appointed by the Association of Municipal Licensees should adhere to the guidelines provided in the previously mentioned IOD/LOI/Annexure II. For instance:



- In the Island City, a Rehab Component comprised of an FSI of 1.33 or FSI required for actual rehabilitation is added with the actual area of the common toilets/ amenities provided and 50% of the actual area of common passages provided, while the Incentive Component accounts for 60% of the rehab area, and the balance sharing is 1:0.6 (MCGM: Private entity/Developer).


- In the suburbs, alongside an FSI of 1 or the FSI needed for actual rehabilitation, the Rehab Component includes the actual space of common toilets/amenities and half the area of common passages provided. The Incentive Component makes up 100% of the rehab area, whereas the balance sharing is worked out to 1:1 (MCGM: Private entity/developer).



Lastly, the remaining FSI over this table up to the Maximum permissible FSI may be shared between the MCGM & developers appointed by the association of licensees of the Municipal markets according to a basic ratio, Therefore, the balance FSI up to Maximum permissible FSI mentioned earlier can be shared as follows:



- If the Basic Ratio (LR/RC) surpasses 6.00, the sharing of Balance FSI as Promoter / Developer Share is 35%, and the sharing of Balance FSI as MCGM Share is 65%.


# Detailed Guidelines for Additional Floor Space Index (FSI) Applicable to Certain Categories Under Development and Redevelopment Initiatives



The present segment is dedicated to discussing the potential extra Floor Space Index (FSI) that can be provided to certain specified groups, with a particular focus on the clause 33(21)(C), dealing with the ongoing Development and Redevelopment initiatives targeting Municipal Markets reconstruction by Developers appointed by the Association of Municipal market licensees. 



- When the basic ratio (LR/RC) as of the date of plan approval exceed 6.00, there might be a potential allowance of an additional FSI of 35% for the Developer and 65% for the Municipal Corporation.


- If the basic ratio (LR/RC) is above 4.00 and up to 6.00, the proposed FSI distribution could include 40% for the Developer and 60% for the Municipal Corporation.


- For basic ratio (LR/RC) up to 4.00, both Developer and Municipal Corporation might each be granted an extra 50% FSI.



This proposed sharing ratio takes into consideration the current market recession and will remain valid for three years from the date of the IOD issuance. Should the construction and part occupancy certificate (OC) of the Rehab + M.C.G.M component not be completed and submitted by the Developer or Association within these three years from the date of Commencement Certificate (CC), a revised policy will be put into effect. 



Existing licensees must be housed on the ground floor and up to the 2nd floors. Therefore, the MCGM's Floor Space Area's share is usually situated on the top floors where it is used for commercial Project-Affected Persons' (PAPs) relocation. Nonetheless, the Developer / Project proponents may choose to pay a compensation per MCGM policy, to use a portion or entire share of MCGM builtup area, thus treating it as a sale component for free sale in the open market. 



The easing of building and other necessities for the rehabilitation component outlined in clause 8 of regulation 33(7) of DCPR 2034 will apply to Municipal markets redevelopment by developers appointed by the association of licensees. Furthermore, the Fungible Area/Fungible Compensatory Area as referred to in regulation 31(3) of DCPR 2034 will be deemed acceptable. Particularly, the Fungible Area for the Developer's sale component will require a premium charge. All in all, all the statutory requirements of MCGM including the approval of the Improvements Committee/ Corporation for the suggestion as per MCGM policy must be complied with.

# Detailed Explanation on Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses



The following segment delves into the topic of Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses. In this context, it's important to articulate that the proposed Land-use plan illustrates the segregated zones based on their specific uses. The division into zones is essential in optimizing the land use for a variety of purposes. The implemented zoning structure is indicative of the allowable uses of land as per the plan.


# Heading 1 - Land Use and Zoning Regulations - Permissible Uses



## Subheading 1.a - Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses: General Guidelines



1. For any proposed land development, it is mandatory that the intended use is in adherence with the permissible uses set for the specific zone where the land is located.



Note: The importance of the intended use being in agreement with the zone's permissible uses cannot be overstated. Kindly ensure diligent compliance for efficient land development.



(# This structuration respects the core theme of land use and zoning regulations, specifically focusing on the alignment of intended land usage with the permissible uses defined for the specific land zone. Each sentence stands on its own while also aligning contextually with the main topic and subtopics.)


# Detailed Exposition of Land-Use Zoning and Permitted Uses: Understanding Zoning Definitions 



This segment of the document elaborates on various zoning definitions in the context of the Proposed Land-use Plan. Different land use zones have been clearly marked out in the plan.



## The Zoning Definitions Table (Table No. A)


- The Residential Zone (R Zone), represented by 'R', is a mixed-use zone where residential use prevails. Other uses as outlined are permitted here.


- The Commercial Zone (C Zone), represented by 'C', is a mixed-use zone with commercial use being the major one, while other specified uses are also permitted.


- The Industrial Zone (I Zone), represented by 'I', is primarily tailored towards manufacturing activities. Here, warehousing and logistics are also permissible. New industrial activities should be non-polluting, non-hazardous, and will require clearance from MPCB. Existing industrial users are protected, given they have certification by MPCB. Land use conversion is permissible as detailed in these Regulations.


- The Special Development Zone, denoted by 'SDZ', is geared towards societal development with a particular emphasis on Affordable Housing, POS, and necessary Social infrastructures.


- Port’s Operational Zone (POZ) is specifically demarcated for the development of Port and Port-related activities.


- The Port’s Water Front Development Zone (PWFDZ) is a zone that centers on the development of waterfront areas with mixed land use.


- Natural Area Zone (NA) is an environmentally sensitive zone conducive to buildable development given the Competent Authority's approval.


- The Green Zone (GZ), fosters large areas predominantly filled with green cover. 



**Note**: In line with the spirit and intent of these Regulations, the boundary limit of a zone may be modified if the boundary line of the zone divides a plot. This modification can only be performed with the special permission of the Commissioner.


# Detailed Explanation of Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses



This segment provides exhaustive definitions regarding land use zoning and the uses permitted within these zones. 



The primary goal of these regulatory measures is to ensure environmental compatibility within each specific zone. This entails permitting activities that align with the zone's purpose on a given plot of land whilst actively preventing activities that conflict with the zone's environmental compatibility.



In scenarios where an activity, not explicitly outlined in these regulations, is proposed, the Commissioner reserves the right to make a decision on its approval or rejection through special permission.



## Defined Conditions for Permittable Land Uses



A significant aspect of these regulations concerns the particular conditions under which land uses are acceptable within clean zones. Essential rules necessary for compliance are elucidated in Table No. C.



Subsequently, this segment elaborates on these regulations as listed in Table No. B. It serves to describe the specific parameters which should be observed when determining permissible land-use within each zone.


# Detailed Land Use Zoning & Various Permissible Occupancies


In the context of 'Land use Zoning & Uses Permitted', the different conditions under which land-use and occupancies are permissible are as follows:



1. Land-use and occupancy are permissible on an independent plot. 


2. An independent building is also a suitable condition for land-use and occupancy.

# Detailed Analysis of Land-use Zoning and Its Permitted Uses



In this segment, we delve deep into the intricacies related to 'Land-use Zoning & Its Permitted Uses'. 



Terminologies related to zoning are defined with examples such as 'Road', 'Manav Mandir Road', and 'Proposed Roads having a width of 45.70 m and above'. 



Next, we discuss the conditions that must be met to permit various land uses and occupancies. The guidelines and protocols are primarily dependent on the characteristics of the zone, be it Residential, Commercial, or Industrial. These specifics, originally described in Table No. B, are further elaborated in Table No. C.



As part of the description, we introduce some signifiers, such as 'P' and 'NP'. 



- The symbol 'P' denotes permissible use without any conditions attached within a specific Zone. However, if conditions exist without an explicit representation of 'P', it implies that the uses are permissible in that zone, but only subject to the compliance with those stated conditions. 



- On the other hand, 'NP' represents non-permissible uses within a Zone. 



By understanding and abiding by these specifications and conditions, one can fully leverage the zoning laws and regulations for Land-use. 



Section heading: `# Detailed Analysis of Land-use Zoning and Its Permitted Uses`


# Detailed Guide on Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses



## Zoning Definitions and Permitted Use Conditions



The section defines the zoning and details the conditions under which various uses and occupancies are permitted in different Zones - Residential (R), Commercial (C), and Industrial (I). 


- **Residential:**  
  In the Residential zone, Residential use is permissible without any conditions, as indicated by [P] for Permissible Use. For the same use in the Commercial zone, it's allowed under several conditions: it can be on an independent plot [1], in an independent building [2], in a separate wing with separate access [3], or on a separate floor with separate access [4]. In contrast, Residential use is not permissible in the Industrial zone, as denoted by [NP] for Non-Permissible Uses. An additional condition applies in the Central Business District (CBD), where the Floor Space Index (FSI) is regulated as per Regulation No 33(19), but it requires compliance with one of the conditions of having an independent plot, building, wing, or floor access.

- **Customary Home Occupations:**  
  Customary home occupations, which include professional works from home, are permissible in the Residential zone without any conditions, denoted by [P]. In the Commercial zone, these occupations are allowed under similar conditions as residential use: they can operate on an independent plot [1], in an independent building [2], in a separate wing with separate access [3], or on a separate floor with separate access [4]. However, these uses are non-permissible in the Industrial zone, indicated by [NP]. In the CBD, FSI regulation as per Regulation No 33(19) applies, subject to compliance with the same conditions required for residential use in the Commercial zone.

- **Residential Care Activities:**

## Conditions Governing Service Industrial Usage



In the context of Service Industrial users, category II industries, including Food Products, are permitted under maximum permissible power, employment, and floor area allowances. The Food Products industry governed by these provisions can include operations such as Ground nut decorticators, Grain mill for production of flour, Manufacture of supari and masala grinding, Rice-hullers, Manufacture of milk and dairy products, Manufacture of ice- cream and ice candy. Each industry is restricted to a maximum permissible power of 7.5KW, a maximum permissible employment of 9 people, and a maximum floor area of 50 sq m.



These industries are also guided by special conditions in regard to fuel usage where the fuels used shall be electricity, gas or smokeless fuel, and may not have a floor above the furnace portion. Where only an electric oven is used in these industries, an additional heating load of 24 KVA per establishment is permitted.



The same conditions similarly govern industries of category II that engage in the manufacture of bakery products, Coffee curing, roasting, and grinding, and the manufacture of ice - albeit with some variances in maximum permissible power, employment, and floor area allowances. For instance, a bakery manufacturing unit is accorded a maximum permissible power of 10KW, a maximum permissible employment of 25 people, and a floor area of 250 sq m. Meanwhile, coffee curing, roasting and grinding units possess a much lower maximum permissible power of 1.5KW but share identical employment and floor area restrictions with Food Products. Lastly, the manufacture of ice falls under a distinctly high permissible power of 45.0KW, maximum 20 employees, and an assigned floor area of 250 sq m. 



This table thus encapsulates the specific parameters and conditions associated with different industries under the category of Service Industry in the realm of zoning and land use.

# Detailed Explanation on Zoning & Permissible Land Uses


Based on the Land use and Zoning regulations, industries and services are assigned certain operational parameters. Here are explicit zoning definitions and distinctions:



- Industry Xli (Repacking and mixing of liquids, powders, pastes etc., not involving any chemical reaction which is non-hazardous in nature), as per the Serial Number XI, is allowed a maximum permissible power of 2.25 kW, and maximum permissible employment of 9 people and a maximum permissible floor area of 50 square meters. No special conditions are specified for this category.



- Business or Administrative office (category Xlii) as per the Serial Number XII, does not have applicable limits for power, employment, floor area, or special conditions.



- Category Xliii, Business/Administrative Offices of the Service Industry/Small Scale Industry within the same premises, under Serial XII, does not have specified limits for power and employment. However, they are allowed 50% of the area under the Service Industry/Small Scale Industry for their floor area without further special conditions.



It's important to note the government might make amendments to the service industrial uses from time to time. Additionally, the Commissioner has the authority to alter, amend or add to these Tables with special permission.



Additionally, conditions also govern other uses permitted in the Residential and Industrial Zones:



- For a Residential Zone, the front portion of the property, abutting the street, must provide a 12-meter gap from the building line. Special conditions are applied for shops and interruption of power subject to the Commissioner's discretion.



- In the Industries Zone, if a plot becomes unbuildable for industrial use because of restrictions from the Industrial Location Policy of Government of Maharashtra or segregating distances under these regulations, several other uses may be permitted. These include fuel stations/service stations/motor garages, parking lots/parking garages, electric substations, public utility offices, government offices, police stations, warehouses, community facilities, convenience shops, hotels (with rooms not exceeding 75), and bank branches with safe deposit vaults.



Finally, the Commissioner has the authority to make alterations, amendments to or additions to this list of permissible uses.


# Land Use Zoning: Uses Permitted and Exceptions 



## Land Use Zoning Exceptions in Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Zones



There exist certain exceptions to the permissible uses in the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Zones. One such exception allows existing authorized uses in the zone not listed among the permissible uses to continue under specific circumstances. This implies that any lawful use of land/building premises present before the implementation of these Regulations may persist even after redevelopment/reconstruction, given it doesn't extend or enlarge other than as provided by these Rules. 



If a building accommodating any non-conforming use collapses, is dismantled, or destroyed, any new building on the site should align with these Regulations and the prescribed land use for the plot in the DP. 



In rehabilitation schemes undertaken by the Mumbai Repair and Reconstruction Board (a MHADA unit) or the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA) or in the Dharavi Redevelopment Project, where a new building replaces an old one with authorized non-conforming uses, the Commissioner may allow the same non-conforming use in the new construction. This exception applies as long as the use is not industrial, hazardous, or likely to cause pollution. In the case of an industrial zone, authorized residential use may be permitted only in an independent building. 



During redevelopment, existing authorized non-residential uses in a residential building will be permitted to continue on the ground, first or second floor, or above stilts/parking floors or in a separate building wing with the special permission of the Commissioner.



All non-conforming uses that were permitted or existed before 01.04.1962, including non-hazardous, non-polluting industries, may continue without additions to such non-conforming use. 



Non-conforming industries, which are neither hazardous nor polluting and have been permitted to operate without the requirement of relocating to a conforming zone, may, with the Commissioner's special permission, be allowed to make additions to start a new process or to manufacture new products. However, these additions must not in any way affect the level of nuisance from the existing unit, complying with the Regulations' requirements for such additions.



In the Commercial and Industrial Zone, if an entire building is constructed for non-residential use, the requirement of separate access won't be insisted upon.



## Prohibition of Factories in Residential Buildings in Conforming Zones



Factories are not permitted in residential buildings in conforming zones.


# Land Use Zoning and Permitted Uses: Exceptions and Special Development Zone (SDZ) Regulations



## Exception Regulations for Land Use Zoning


Regardless of what is stated in these Regulations, no authorization should be provided for setting up any factory, workshop, or workplace (which needs preliminary approval under section 390 of the MMC Act, 1888) entirely or partially on lands utilized for residential intentions, even if such utilization complies with these Regulations and the aforementioned Act. However, the usage of a residential building that is compatible with residential use, unless otherwise specified, can be permitted on the ground floor.



Concerning the Municipal land of the Municipal Octroi Nakas, denoted for existing 'Truck Terminus' or otherwise, it should be constructed as a 'Comprehensive Transport Hub'. This implies inclusion of a bus/truck terminus, and such land will be perceived as falling into the commercial zone for development besides its primary function, in accordance with the relevant provisions of these Regulations. If MCGM proposes development on its own, the payment of a premium for Built-Up Area (BUA) beyond zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) will not be required. Conversely, premium payment will apply if the project is developed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model or allowed to be developed by any other agency, excluding the area to be transferred to MCGM. Additionally, if a comprehensive transport hub, like a bus/truck terminus, is developed combined with commercial development, the area required for vehicle parking and vehicle maneuverability of the terminus should be allowed free of FSI.



## Special Development Zone (SDZ) Regulations for Land Use Zoning


A Special Development Zone (SDZ) is a zone meant to be developed predominantly for the greater public, with a focus on Affordable Housing, POS, and necessary social infrastructures. The development of an SDZ will be managed under the provision of regulation 33(8). It is important to note that structures triggering the provisions of the Maharashtra Slums Areas (Improvement, Clearance, and Redevelopment) Act, 1971, should be developed under the preconditions of Regulation 33(10).


# Detailed Rules and Guidelines for Land Use Zoning & Permitted Uses in Special Development Zones (SDZ)



This segment provides detailed information on the permissions and restrictions for various types of land use within Special Development Zones (SDZ). 



1. **General Rules for Other Developments in SDZ**:


   Other permitted uses in SDZ are contingent on the condition that the corporation will not provide any services or will only provide limited services. No subdivision of land creating plots smaller than 2.0 hectares will be permitted.



2. **Guidelines for Institutional Development / Convention Centre**:


   Institutional developments such as higher educational institutions, medical institutions, urban planning institutions, financial institutions, and research and development institutions are permissible in SDZ under certain conditions. The maximum Floor Space Index (FSI) limit is 0.20 excluding areas of DP road. The development must ideally involve one location of the total land. Ground coverage shall not exceed 10% of the plot's area and tree plantation at a rate of 500 trees per hectares must be performed on the remaining land. Additionally, upto 33% of the permissible Built-Up Area (BUA) can be allocated for essential residential development to house staff or officers.

5. **Tourism Development Area(TDA)**:


   Specific details pertaining to Tourism Development Area (TDA) under the LDZ context are yet to be outlined in this segment.


#  An Overview of Land Use Zoning & Uses Permitted in Tourism Development Areas


This section discusses the specifics of development regulations in Special Development Zones (SDZ) and Tourism Development Areas (TDA), as defined by the Tourism Department of the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) in consultation with the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC).



Government of Maharashtra, in consultation with the MTDC, regularly identifies sites suitable for promoting tourism. These selected locations could serve as holiday resorts, beach resorts, hotels, motels, and similar amenities. They may also host additional facilities such as restaurants, health farms, water sport facilities, art and craft complexes, golf courses, gliding and grass skiing facilities, marinas, jetties, pontoons for boat docking, and swimming pools.



The GoM permits these identified sites, located within the SDZ, to be developed for such tourism-promoting activities. Even though these sites are in the SDZ, they can be developed with a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 0.50, excluding the area of DP road. Contrary to usual Regulations, no additional FSI will be granted in these zones.



A note of caution is that sites not located within an SDZ or Natural Area will have FSI permissions based on their respective zoning regulations, specifically detailed in Table 12 of Regulation No.30(1)(A).



The delineation and development of TDAs fall under specific guidelines. Generic rules include that a TDA can be developed by an individual, a company, a partnership firm, or a government/semi-government organization. These guidelines are strictly applicable to all TDAs. Proposals for land to be marked as TDA need to be approved by the Urban Development (UD) department, GOM. However, plots reserved or designated for playgrounds, parks, gardens, or other Point of Service (POS) reservations are not permissible to be marked as TDAs.



When it comes to identifying lands as Tourism Development Areas, proposals are evaluated and if deemed suitable, recommended by a committee within the Urban Development Department. This committee is known as the Tourism Development Area Committee.


# Detailed Explanation of Land Use Zoning & Permitted Uses in Tourism Development 



Implementing zoning laws and permitted uses for tourism development engages a specific Committee. This Committee is formally known as the Tourism Development Area Committee or TDAC. It consists of several key members with varying roles and responsibilities:



1. The Chairman of TDAC is the Secretary from the Tourism Development Department in Mantralaya.


2. The Metropolitan Commissioner from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) is a Member of the TDAC.


3. The Municipal Commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai also holds a membership position in the TDAC.


4. The Deputy Director of Town Planning from Greater Mumbai acts as a Member of the TDAC.


5. A representative with ties to the Hotel Industries in Mumbai is included as a Member in the TDAC.


6. The inclusion of an Environmentalist as a Member within the TDAC exemplifies the consideration towards the environmental implications during the development.


7. Lastly, an Architect having 20 years experience in architectural practice is also a crucial member of this TDAC.



It is noteworthy that the committee's membership at points 5, 6, and 7 is nominated by the Secretary of the Tourism Department. The appointment tenure for these positions changes every three years. Yet, a same individual maintains eligibility for reappointment as a Member.


# Detailed Guidelines on Land Use, Zoning, and Permitted Uses in Special Development Zones (SDZ)



Under the topic of land use regulation, specifically about Special Development Zone (SDZ) management, this segment provides specific information on the maximum Total Development Area (TDA) permissible within a given holding in an SDZ.



For SDZ-II holdings that are more than 2 hectares but less than 5 hectares, the maximum fixed TDA permissible is 40% of the total area. Furthermore, a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 0.5 over the TDA area is allowed, which is subject to a premium of 10% of the Annual Schedule Rate (ASR). This premium hovers over the basic zonal FSI of 0.025 applicable for the SDZ, with 50% of this premium being paid to both the State Government and the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MCGM).



Similarly, for SDZ-II holdings that are equal to or more than 5 hectares but less than 6 hectares, the maximum TDA permissible is 50%, and the FSI conditions remain unchanged.



Following the pattern, holdings equal to or more than 6 hectares but less than 7 hectares are permitted a maximum TDA of 60%, and those between 7 hectares and 8 hectares can utilise 70% of the total area as TDA. Holdings ranging from 8 to 9 hectares have an 80% TDA permission, while those between 9 and 10 hectares can utilise 90%. SDZ-II holdings that equal to or more than 10 hectares are allowed to use up to 100% as TDA. FSI permissions and conditions remain the same across all these categories.



Specific conditions for FSI use apply. After deducting the TDA, the remaining FSI will be available for the rest of the land in SDZ, following the specifications under clause (VI)(xii). For plots larger than 2 hectares, no subdivision is allowed. 



On smaller plots held by existing landholders within an SDZ, Tourism has been promoted through bed-and-breakfast type arrangements. These arrangements must follow the rules approved by the Government in the Urban Development Department, and required to follow the same FSI as stated in regulation (A)(VI).



However, certain types of land are not permissible for inclusion as TDA. These include those excessively affected by pollution, as determined and certified by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB), and lands covered by mangroves.


# Detailed Outline of Land Use, Zoning, and Permitted Uses



## Maximum Permissible Total Development Area (TDA) in Special Development Zones (SDZ)



In Special Development Zones (SDZ), the maximum area allowed as Total Development Area (TDA) shall vary according to the following specifications: 



- Lands that are covered by mangroves have their own specific guidelines concerning permissible TDA. 


- Areas from the SDZ that directly abut the Residential Zone, without separation by a road of no less than 18.30 meters wide, have distinctive regulations for permissible TDA. 



## Policies for Infrastructural Facilities in SDZ



The on-site infrastructural facilities mandated by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) will need to be provided by the developer independently. Suitable treatment and disposal processes for sewage, sullage, and solid waste should satisfy the standards of MCGM and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). There should be no discharge of untreated waste into any water body.



## Reserved Sites for Tourism Development in Unique Areas



Sites that are uniquely situated or offer unusual features such as a water body, scenic beauty, tree plantations, or a geological formation, can be designated as TDA for the purpose of promoting tourism. However, these sites should not be smaller than 1.00 hectares. In such sites, the usable floor space index for construction should not exceed 0.20.



## Special Provisions for Environmentally Sensitive Areas



Locations recognized for their ecological heritage or rare migratory bird arrivals will be preferred for development as a TDA. 



## Special Provisions for Mega Tourism Projects



Per the Tourism Policy of Maharashtra 2016, projects recognized as Mega Tourism Projects by the Tourism and Cultural Affairs Department are subject to certain exclusive provisions.



- The permissible ground coverage for such projects is half of the total TDA.

- Building heights of up to 70 meters may be allowed for film studios, adhering to the provisions of Regulation 47. 


- Furthermore, a Compensatory Floor Space Index of up to 35% may be allowed, subject to Regulation 31(3) provisions.



Please note that developments in Eco Sensitive or Coastal Regulation Zones will be regulated according to MoEF's notifications and circulars issued periodically.



## Provisions for Amusement Parks



Amusement parks may be built on a plot of not less than 4 hectares. These amusement parks could include experiences such as giant wheels, roller coasters, merry-go-rounds, ocean-parks, swimming pools, magic mountains, lakes, ethnic villages, and souvenir, toy, goods, refreshments, and beverage shops. However, the permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) should not exceed 0.025 (excluding the area of DP road). The entire land for the amusement park should be under a single ownership and can't be subdivided at any time.

  - Establishment of gardens and poultry farms.


  - Forestry operations.


  - Setting up golf clubs and links.


# Detailed Overview of Land Use Zoning & Uses Permitted



The segment describes the regulations regarding the maximum permissible area for different types of establishments in a Sustainable Development Zone (SDZ). 



- For golf clubs and links, the maximum area permissible as a Total Development Area (TDA) within the SDZ is governed by specific stipulations.


- The same holds for recreational areas such as public parks, private parks, playfields, stadia, gymkhanas, swimming pools, and gliding facilities. It also includes temporary recreational camps of all types.


- The permissible TDA in an SDZ caters for race tracks and shooting ranges.


- Fish curing on open land and fish farming are also among the permitted uses for land in an SDZ.


- An exception allows for salt manufacture from seawater within specific sectors of an SDZ.


- Public utility establishments inclusive of electric sub-stations, receiving stations, switch yards, overhead line corridors, radio and TV stations, main stations for public gas distribution, sewage treatment, disposal works, stormwater drain pumping stations, and solid waste disposal facilities are permitted. They can also include residential quarters for essential staff. This usage is subject to the special permission of the Commissioner.


- Land in an SDZ can be used for cemeteries and crematoria, including related structures.


- The regulations allow for structures such as watchmen's quarters within an SDZ, subject to a size limit of 20 square meters each. The number of such structures in each plot is decided by the Commissioner.


- A residential building within an SDZ can be no more than ground plus one story, with a maximum height of 9.75 meters, including the stilted portion.



In the SDZ around Vihar and Pawailake, the rules specify an exclusive green belt of 100 m to prevent soil erosion and silting in the lakes. No construction is allowed in this area. If a municipal or public road exists within 100 m from this periphery, the need for a buffer green belt beyond the road may not be required.


# Detailed Guidelines on Zoning & Permitted Uses in Natural Areas (NA) under Land Use Regulations



The Natural Areas (NA) represents an environmentally receptive sector earmarked for buildable development, that is subject to the nod from the pertinent authority. Numerous facilities, including board walks in mangroves, trekking facilities, visitor-friendly public sanitary conveniences, and sewerage pumping stations are generally permissible within this zone.



As per the clauses specified in the notifications tendered by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, there are additional uses that could be allowed within the defined natural territory. However, these permissions are susceptible to amendments that might be introduced periodically.



It's important to note that any structures built within the Natural Area (NA), with the rightful endorsement of the Competent Authority before these rules came into effect, are considered legitimate and safeguarded. 



Furthermore, reservations proposed for development within the Natural Area are permissible, in alignment with the development standards applied to other zones. Obtaining approval from the Competent Authority is a prerequisite for such developments, in complement with adhering to the stipulated conditions articulated in the notifications issued periodically by the Ministry of Environment and Forest.


#  Chapter 34: Land Use Management - Zoning and Permitted Uses


## Subheading 3.8: Green Zone (GZ) Land Use and Approved Activities 



The Green Zone (GZ) denotes a vast area characterized by an abundant green cover. The use of this zone allows for several facilities and activities, which are permissible under various specific conditions. 



In the Green Zone, construction of a zoo is permitted, subject to a Floor Space Index (FSI) of 0.025.



Approved uses by the Government of Maharashtra within the Green Zone could be allowed, provided they receive approval from the Ministry of Environment and Forest.



The Green Zone could accommodate for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the forest's original inhabitants, like the adivasis and tribals of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, in accordance with Regulation No.30 relating to Zonal (basic) FSI.



It is essential to note that all structures constructed in the Green Zone, which received sanction from the Competent Authority before these regulations were implemented, remain protected. 



Additionally, any proposed reservation within the Green Zone may be developed at par with other zones, given approval from the Competent Authority and compliant with conditions stipulated in notifications issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forest, as amended periodically.


# Detailed Explanation on the Development or Redevelopment of Cotton Textile Mill Lands



The text discusses the redevelopment or development process for the lands of cotton textile mills, particularly those that are sick and/or closed—subject to the Commissioner's prior approval and provided conditions deemed appropriate by him.



1. The Commissioner may issue an approval for a layout prepared for the comprehensive development or redevelopment of open land and the built-up area of a chronically ill or closed cotton textile mill. This approval could be part of a package of measures recommended by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) aimed at the revival or rehabilitation of a potentially viable ill or closed mill. 



2. The existing built-up areas of a cotton textile mill may be repurposed under specific conditions: 



    * First, such areas may be used for the continuation of cotton textile production or related activities, subject to compliance with all other laid out regulations.



    * Second, they can be used for diversified industrial purposes aligning with the industrial location policy, with office space only as a secondary and necessary part of such uses. This direction needs to be followed while respecting all other regulations.


    
    * Thirdly, it may also be permitted for commercial purposes, as stipulated by these regulations.


# Detailed Explanation of the Development or Redevelopment Guidelines for Cotton Textile Mills Lands



The guidelines concerning the usage of open lands and balance FSI for the development or redevelopment of cotton textile mills are explicated in the subsequent paragraphs. Each component of the available table data has been reframed as independent sentences for an optimized, AI-centered searchability, correspondingly resonating with the core theme of cotton textile mills development and redevelopment.



In the context of cotton textile mills development and redevelopment, Serial Number 1 corresponds with a land extent with no limit.



For the development or redevelopment of cotton textile mills lands with no limit on extent, as specified by the Commissioner, 33% of the land area will be earmarked for the formation of gardens, playgrounds or any other Public Open Spaces (POS).



For the same land extent under the redevelopment of cotton textile mills, 33% has to be earmarked and given up for development by MHADA for Public Housing. This includes the housing for mill workers as per the guidelines ratified by the Government, and this percentage is to be shared equally.



For the development or redevelopment of unlimited extent cotton textile mills lands, the remaining 34% is to be earmarked and developed for residential or commercial use. This includes permissions for residential or commercial zone uses statutory to these regulations, or for diversified industrial uses per the Industrial Location Policy. The development of this fraction of the earmarked percentage is to be managed by the landowner.



The provisions mentioned above, however, have been kept in abeyance.


# Detailed Discussion on the Development or Redevelopment of Cotton Textile Mills Lands 



## Key Guidelines Regarding Continuation of Cotton Textile Mills Land Development



- The land allocated for garden, playground, or other open uses as demonstrated in column (3) of the related Table should also include open spaces, public amenities, and utilities as required under these Regulations for the lands shown in columns (4) and (5). 



- According to these Regulations, a segregating distance should be provided within the lands purposed for residential or commercial uses. 



- The landowner will be qualified for the Floor Space Index (FSI) as per Regulation No 30(A)(1) and (4), excluding the area of notional plots of residential buildings or chawls located on the lands of Cotton Textile Mills, if any.



- If there is a remaining FSI, but open land is not available, then for the purposes of column (3) and (4), the land will be opened up by demolishing the existing structures as necessary and providing it accordingly. 



## Special Policies for Small Land Parcels and Composite Scheme Submission 



- If the lands accumulated as per Columns (3) & (4) are deemed by the Commissioner to be of such small sizes that they do not allow for separate specific uses, the Commissioner may earmark the lands for use as provided in Column (3). 



- It is permissible for the landowners to submit a composite scheme for the development or redevelopment of lands of different cotton textile mills, whether under different/common ownership or otherwise. The lands included in the integrated scheme will be considered by the Commissioner in an integrated manner. 



- The land to be surrendered as per column no (3) and (4) should preferably be handed over in the respective land of mills. However, if the owner intends to transfer the share of land as per column no (3) and (4) at another mill within the integrated scheme with varying stamp duty ready reckoner rates, then the area to be surrendered should be in proportion to the stamp duty ready reckoner rate of these lands of mills. 



## Submission and Handover Deadlines



- The mill land layout should be submitted by the mill owner within six months of the mill's closure or within six months from the sanction of these Regulations, whichever is later. 



- The land allocated for the Maharashtra Housing Area Development Authority (MHADA) & Public Open Spaces (POS) should be handed over to the concerned Authority within six months after the approval of the layout, with the transfer period not exceeding six months.





# Development or Redevelopment of Lands of Cotton Textile Mills


## Permitted Modernization of Active Mills


Upon receiving the Commissioner's approval of a layout strategically prepared for the development or redevelopment of both open and built-up areas within a cotton textile mill that isn't sick or shut, but in need of modernization, development or redevelopment will be permitted. This is on the condition that it aligns with a scheme ratified by the Government. The clause (a) of sub-Regulation (1) of this Regulation, relating to the utilization of built-up area, should be applied.



## Development After Shifting of Mills


In the event where a cotton textile mill is relocated outside of Greater Mumbai but remains within the State boundaries, legal permission from the competent authorities is required. The stipulations provided in sub-clauses (a) and (b) of Sub-Regulation (1) of this Regulation will be applicable regarding development or redevelopment of the mill's utilizable land post shifting.



## Exemption for BIFR Recommendation


The practice of recommendation by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) is considered non-mandatory in the contexts that are pointed out in sub-Regulations (2) and (3).



## Additional Development Possibilities


The Commissioner can permit additional development in respect to any leftover Floor Space Index (FSI) on vacant lands or equivalent, executed by the cotton textile mill for similar cotton textile or interrelated applications.



## Conditions for Mills Requiring Modernization or Closed


With the approval of the Commissioner on a development or redevelopment layout prepared for any open land or built up area belonging to a cotton textile mill that is either ailing, closed, or requiring modernization, the Commissioner can allow:


   * Reconstruction after the dismantling of the existing structures restricted to the built-up area of the destroyed structures, possibly by joining in one or multiple structures the built-up areas of the demolished structures.


   * Aggregation of built-up areas of existing structures from numerous mills, regardless of being under common ownership or not, through a comprehensive scheme for the demolition and reconstruction of the existing structures. This is based on the condition that there is equilibrium with the Floor Space Index (FSI) on the receiving mill's land.



However, the Floor Space Index (FSI) on each separate plot of the comprehensive scheme of mill land, as given in column number 5 of the table of sub-regulation 1(b) above (excluding the area of theoretical plot of residential buildings/chawls located on cotton textile mills lands, if any) should not surpass 4.





# Detailed Analysis of the Development or Redevelopment of Lands of Cotton Textile Mills



## Continuation Clause 7(A) Explained 



According to clause 7(A) in the segment, whenever the built-up areas of a cotton textile mill are developed or redeveloped for residential or residential cum commercial purposes from January 1, 2000, there is an obligation on the part of the land owner to provide each tenant impacted by the development or redevelopment a free alternative tenement that is equivalent to 405 square feet in carpet area. Moreover, no tenant can be evicted until they are equipped with a suitable 405 square feet alternative accommodation under the new scheme. It's also important to note that the so-called fungible compensatory area permitted under Regulation No 31(3) for the rehabilitation component is not applicable to residential or residential cum commercial units. The compensatory area under Regulation No 31(3) is only allocated for nonresidential units or existing authorized spaces. 



## Redevelopment Requirements for Residential Buildings Located on Lands of Cotton Textile Mills



Considering centroids planning for the reconstruction or redevelopment of residential buildings situated on the lands of Cotton Textile Mills, there are specific conditions that must be met. For instance, the redevelopment of buildings that form part of larger holdings must take into account the notional area of the plot based on Zonal (basic) FSI and the total built-up area of the building. In light of such a notional area, an FSI of 4.0 will be permitted. 



## Calculating the FSI of 4.0



To calculate an FSI of 4.0, the Rehab area will be taken into account. The Rehab area refers to the total built-up area needed to accommodate all occupants of residential buildings or chawls, with a carpet area of 37.63 square meters (or 405 sq. ft), or the existing carpet area, whichever is higher. In situations where there are non-residential occupants that were in place as of January 1, 2000, the area allocated in the reconstructed building would be equivalent to the area previously occupied within the old structure.



Lastly, with regards to the difference between FSI 4.0 and the FSI used for the rehabilitation of existing occupants, this difference shall be divided into two parts in a ratio of 1:60. Of these two parts, one part will be constructed by the mill owners in the form of additional tenements measuring 27.88 sq. m (or 300 sq. ft) each, and these tenements will be handed over to MHADA/Government for the rehabilitation of mill workers. The mill owners will be entitled to an FSI of above 0.6 in return for the construction handed over to MHADA/Government.


#  Procedures and Regulations for the Development or Redevelopment of Cotton Textile Mill Lands



##  Continuation of Guidelines for Residential Buildings and Employment Provisions in Cotton Textile Mill Redevelopment



The mill owner is tasked with the construction aimed at rehabilitating all residents of the existing residential buildings or chawls on the mill lands. The landlord or Cooperating Housing Society of the occupiers receives no incentive Floor Space Index (FSI) against this construction.



The occupants of the old building will be resettled in the new, redeveloped building. For case building situations, MHADA will certify both the list of occupants and the area occupied by each resident in the old building.



There exist provisions for dispute resolution; any disputes should be referred to the Monitoring Committee, with the committee’s decision being final and binding upon all parties involved.



Upon completion of construction, the developer is obliged to deposit an amount of Rs. 50,000 per tenement into a corpus fund with the society of occupants. This deposit is intended for the maintenance of the buildings.



The clause 8 of regulation No. 33(7), which has been amended from time to time, shall equally apply despite the regulations contained herein.



In the event of a cotton textile mill being relocated or diversifying its industry, the mill owner must offer priority employment to the worker or at least one family member of the worker employed by the mill as of 1st January 2000, provided they possess the required qualifications or skills for the role. Additionally, the mill owner is responsible for and should complete the training of candidates prior to initiating personnel recruitment and operations in the relocated mill or diversified enterprise.



If a cotton textile mill is taken up for development or redevelopment for industrial or commercial purposes, the mill owner, developer, or occupier must provide priority employment to the worker or at least one family member of the worker employed by the mill as of 1st January 2000, again, provided they possess the required qualifications or skills for the role.



Reconstruction or redevelopment by the landlord or cooperating housing society concerning residential buildings or chawls on the lands of cotton textile mills should occur simultaneously with the redevelopment of mill land.



Regarding mills categorized as in distress, closed, requiring modernization, or to be relocated, funds deriving from the utilization of built-up areas under this Regulation should be allocated to an escrow account for future use as provided hereafter.


# Heading 1: Development, Redevelopment, and Financial Control Measures for Cotton Textile Mills 



## Subheading 1: Regulations on the Use of Escrow Accounts for Cotton Textile Mill Development



Clause 35(b) states that the funds credited to the escrow account are only to be utilized for the revival, rehabilitation, modernization, or relocation of the cotton textile mill. It is provisioned that these funds may also be allocated for worker dues, Voluntary Retirement Schemes (VRS) payments, repayment of loans from banks and financial institutions related to the rejuvenation or updating of the mill, or for its shifting outside of Greater Mumbai but within the State. This escrow account can be concluded once all terms and conditions have been met.



## Subheading 2: Monitoring Committee for Implementation of Cotton Textile Mill Redevelopment Measures



Subsection 9(a) asserts that a Monitoring Committee will be appointed by the Government, under the supervision of a retired High Court Judge, to ensure the successful execution of the measures suggested by the Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for the revival and rehabilitation of potentially failing and/or closed textile mills.



Members of this committee will include a representative from the cotton textile mill owners, a recognized cotton textile mill workers union representative, the Commissioner, and a Government representative. The Commissioner is tasked with providing the Monitoring Committee with necessary administrative support and facilities.



## Subheading 3: Mandates of the Monitoring Committee in Cotton Textile Mill Development



The Monitoring Committee bears the responsibility of enforcing sale transparency for built-up spaces, open lands, and remaining Floor Space Index (FSI) by cotton textile mills. They are tasked with monitoring and establishing guidelines for the initiation, operation, and closure of escrow accounts.



The Committee's responsibilities extend to approving proposals for fund withdrawal and allocation from the escrow accounts. They are also to supervise the implementation of housing provisions, alternative employment, and the related training of cotton textile mill workers under this regulation.



The authority granted to the Monitoring Committee includes issuing and enforcing notices and summonses as a Civil Court would. Any judgment or decision reached by the Monitoring Committee is final, irrevocable and binding for all parties involved.



This Committee is also equipped with the decision-making power to determine its own operational procedures and techniques.





# Detailed Overview of the Regulations for Developing or Redeveloping Cotton Textile Mill lands in Greater Mumbai



## General Provisions Governing Such Developments 


In accordance with these regulations, the development or redevelopment of all lands in Greater Mumbai that are owned or held by cotton textile mills shall be governed by this specific set of regulations. This stands notwithstanding any operational status of the mills, land use zoning relating to the lands, the current use of these lands, or any other factor, circumstance or consideration. These lands shall be regulated only by these provisions and not any other regulation except Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) and Fungible Compensatory Floor Space Index (FSI).



## Exclusions for Public Reserved Lands


Nevertheless, lands reserved for public purposes that are owned or held by Cotton Textile Mills shall not fall under the purview of these regulations. Instead, these reserved lands shall either be handed over to Mumbai City and Suburban District (MCGM) or the Appropriate Authority in lieu of TDR or developed according to the provisions laid down under Regulation Number 17.



## Guidelines for Residential Buildings on Reserved Lands


In cases where residential buildings or chawls are situated on a reserved parcel of land, the land component of the chawl should be developed according to the provisions of clause (7) of this regulation, dis-regarding the reservation. The remainder of the reserved land should then be developed as per the regulations specified under Regulation Number 17.



## Provisions for MHADA and MCGM Land Shares


It should be noted that the provisions of sub Regulation no 1(b) of this Regulation will be inapplicable if the share of the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and MCGM land has been transferred according to the then prevailing regulations.



## Exemptions for future amendments in layouts or Development schemes


This regulation will not be applicable to any future amendments that may be proposed in the ongoing layouts or existing integrated development schemes for textile mills, which have been approved under Regulations 58 of Development Control Regulations (DCR) 1991. This exemption applies only when the proportionate share of MCGM/MHADA land as per the approved layout is handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority before the enforcement of this regulation.



## Restriction on Permissible Floor Space Index


In such exempted cases, the total permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) will be capped at a maximum of 4 FSI. However, they may be allowed to utilize this limit through NTC FSI, TDR or additional FSI by payment of premium in various combinations, subject to the discretion of the developer.


#  Determining the Occupancy Load in Buildings Based on Essential Space Standards and Regulations



## Part: The Space Requirements and Associated Standards for Different Building Parts



This segment delineates the standard space requirements for various sections in a building. Concurrently, it includes elements such as light availability, ventilation, building services, and fire safety precautions, which are integral constituents of standard space determination. These guidelines significantly depend on the anticipated number of occupants in the building. The occupancy load is a crucial factor and can be calculated using the data provided in the Table 13, as referred in the context below.



## Sub Part: Person-specific Space Determination in Buildings from Table 13



Initiating the conversion of the table data into sentences and preserving the core theme, each row of the Table 13, relevant to the 'Occupancy Load' heading, will be transformed into distinct sentences that interrelate the table's headers and the segment's central topic. This structured approach ensures the specifications can be distinguished even if similar data falls under a different heading. Since the table structure isn't provided in this segment, further action can't be processed at the moment. However, the convention entails discussing each entity or category in the sequence of table data such as row headers, column headers, and cell information, thereby linking it to the primary topic, which in this case is the 'Occupancy Load' in buildings.


# Detail: Occupancy Load Metrics and Application Based on Type of Occupancy

## Special Needs of Differently abled Persons in Public Spaces such as Auditoriums and Theatres 



In public recreational facilities such as cinemas, theaters, concert halls, and stadiums where permanent fixed seating arrangement is provided, the following rules must be observed:



- At least two wheelchair spaces should be provided for every 200 seats or less. An additional wheelchair space must be accommodated for every subsequent addition of 200 seats or any fraction thereof.



- These accessible seating should be evenly distributed and integrated throughout seating areas of assembly rooms to give differently-abled persons options to choose from different vantage points.



- These wheelchair spaces measuring 0.9 m x 1.2 m each should be located alongside fixed seats, enabling wheelchair users to sit with their able-bodied or ambulant companions.



- All entertainment and assembly areas should accommodate differently abled persons using various mobility aids. 



- These wheelchair spaces must form an integral part of any seating plan. Efforts should be taken to distribute such seating spaces throughout the seating area and in each pricing tier, arranged in a way that it does not obstruct the view of persons seated behind.



## Signage Requirements for Differently Abled Persons 



- Public buildings should use appropriate signage to identify specific facilities for differently-abled persons. 



- Persons with vision impairment rely on other senses such as hearing and touch. Hence, informational boards in braille should be installed at a suitable height and placed closely.



- Persons with hearing disabilities benefit from visual signs. Hence, these should be designed and located in a way they are easily legible with suitable letter sizes (not less than 20 mm high).



- Directional signs and tactile guiding paths should identify and provide a clear sequence from the start point to the destination and indicate return routes to named exits.



- Any existence of steps or ramps on a route should be clearly indicated at both ends of the route.

The information in this segment pertains to special regulations and guidelines established for differently abled persons. These rules serve as benchmarks for building an inclusive and accessible society that caters to the needs of all its members. 



## Subsection 39(5) - Broader References and Provisions



For an in-depth understanding and additional details regarding the special regulations for differently abled persons, various governmental resources can be referred to. 



1. A significant document is The Handbook on Barrier Free and Accessibility published in 2014 by the Central Public Works Department, Government of India. This material provides detailed instructions on creating accessible environments. 



2. Another essential resource is the Model Building Bye-Laws issued by the Town and Country Planning Organisation under the Ministry of Urban Development, Government of India in 2016. These laws contain necessary provisions aimed at making urban spaces more accessible for differently abled persons.



3. The National Building Code, updated to its latest version in 2005 by the Bureau of Indian Standards, is another crucial document. It incorporates specific provisions for designing buildings to be accessible for people with disabilities.



4. Finally, the National Policy for Persons with Disabilities published in 2006 by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India, can be referred to. This policy outlines the government's approach towards ensuring the rights and opportunities for people with disabilities. 



The aforementioned documents serve as comprehensive references, providing guidelines and provisions to be followed for ensuring accessibility for differently abled persons. They have been conceived to foster an inclusive social and physical environment.


# Detailed Guidelines on Lighting and Ventilation for Habitable Rooms



According to section 40, concerning lighting and ventilation specifications, it is mandated that all parts of any habitable room must be adequately illuminated and ventilated. Therefore, every room is obliged to contain one or more apertures excluding doors. The total aperture area required should be no less than one-sixth of the habitable room's floor area. Furthermore, this also stipulates that no part of any habitable room can be more than 7.50 meters away from the source of light or ventilation. 



In the case of staircases, they are considered adequately lighted and ventilated, provided that there is at least one or more openings consolidating an area of not less than 1 square meter per landing on the external wall.



Additionally, every habitable room, inclusive of kitchens, should possess an opening that measures a minimum area of 1 sq. meter, while specifications for bathrooms, water closets, or stores demand an opening with an area of at least 0.3 sq. meters, with one dimension being 0.3 meters.



A requirement to have all the walls that contain the openings for light and ventilation fully exposed to an exterior open space, either directly or through a balcony no wider than 2 meters, is also presented in these guidelines. However, rooms designed for non-residential use are deemed adequately lighted and ventilated if they do not exceed 12 meters depth from the side adjoining the required open space. For centrally air-conditioned buildings, this distance can be extended up to 20 meters.


# Detailed Exposition on Lighting and Ventilation: Artificial Ventilation, Mechanical Systems, and Lighting Provisions



Below are key specifics and standards about artificial ventilation shafts. These shafts can be adjacent to bathrooms, water closets, staircases, or store/prayer rooms. The size of these shafts should align with certain criteria that are primarily dependent on the building's height. Mechanical ventilation systems are an essential part of these ventilation shafts, which should also be conveniently accessible for service purposes.



1. For buildings with a height of up to 12 meters, the cross-section of the ventilation shaft should be 2.8 square meters, and the minimum size of one side of the shaft should be 1.2 meters.



2. Buildings rising to 18 meters need a larger ventilation shaft, having a cross-section of 4.0 square meters with the shortest shaft side measuring 1.5 meters.



3. Structures reaching up to 24 meters require ventilation shafts with a cross-section of 5.4 square meters and the shortest side being 1.8 meters.



4. For buildings that reach heights of up to 30 meters, the ventilation shaft should have an 8.0 square meter cross-section and a 2.4-meter minimum side size. 



5. Buildings that rise above 30 meters demand the largest ventilation shafts, with a cross-section of 9.0 square meters and the lowest shaft side measuring 3.0 meters.



Artificial lighting and mechanical ventilation are imperative where daylighting and natural circulation are insufficient. These features should be implemented according to the provisions in Part VIII, Building Service Section I, Lightning and Ventilation, of the National Building Code. 



In the instance of a residential hotel, where toilets use a mechanical ventilation system, the ventilation shaft size regulations may be suitably adjusted at the Commissioner's discretion.


# Detailed Guidelines on Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



Each individual building or wing within a building layout requires separate and distinct open spaces according to these Regulations. This concept established that open spaces should not be communally shared but should be designated distinctly for each building or wing.



Consider a situation where a building has two or more wings. In such a case, it is necessary for each wing to have separate or distinct open spaces as outlined by these regulations. This ensures that all sections of the building can satisfy the requirements for open spaces.



However, if one of the wings does not depend on the open space between the two wings for light and ventilation, the application of these regulations changes. In this circumstance, the required open space should be the one necessary for the taller wing or the one needed to achieve adequate light and ventilation, whichever is higher.



The requirement for open spaces also extends to achieving full FSI (Floor Space Index) consumption. Specifically, the open spaces left at the sides and rear of a building should be proportionate to the building's height. This stipulation allows for full utilization of the permissible FSI for the occupancy in the specified zone.


# Detailed Explanation and Guidelines for Computing Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



The 41st section focuses on 'Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout', specifically describing the approach of computing the front open space or setback when the relevant street is expected to be widened.



- Regarding the technique of computing the front open space or setback, where the street is planned to undergo broadening either under the Development Plan or due to the determination of regular lines of streets as specified under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act, 1888, the open space or road-side setback will be assessed from the subsequent road widening line. 



- The measurement of the front open space should be carried out perpendicular to the road line as per guideline 41(1)(b)(C). The open spaces designated for light and ventilation should also be measured perpendicular to the building line. Additionally, the open spaces for a dead wall should be gauged perpendicular to the compound wall. 



Each of these stipulations and computations play a crucial role in effectively managing open spaces within building plots or layouts, particularly in scenarios where changes, such as road-widening, are part of future urban development plans. Each measure governs the dimensions of the space and ensures the preservation and optimization of open space within the site's limitations.


# In-depth Analysis and Specifications for Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



In the context of building plots and layouts, we'll shed light on the important aspect of side and rear open spaces. Specifically, these spaces play a crucial role in determining the adequacy of light and ventilation for building structures.



## Rules for Allocating Side and Rear Open Spaces



It's important to note that for all sides of a building, apart from the front side, specific open space allocations need to be followed.



### Side and Rear Marginal Open Space Table A


To illustrate this further, we'll dive into various parameters in the form of a structured table, which we will call 'Table A' - pertaining to side and rear marginal open spaces.



1. For a building having a height up to 32 m on a plot up to 1000 sq. m or where the average width/depth of the plot is less than 20 m, the side and rear marginal open space should be a minimum of 3.6 m in the case of a Residential building & 4.5 m in the case of a commercial building subject to H/5 for light and ventilation and 3.6 m for the dead wall. 



2. If the plot is more than 1000 sq.m and the average width/depth of the plot is more than 20 m, then it should have 3.6 m in the case of a Residential building & 4.5 m in case of a commercial building subject to H/4 for light and ventilation, and 3.6 m for the dead wall. 



3. For a building with a height more than 32 m and up to 70 m on regions of the plot up to 1000 sq. m or where the average width/depth of the plot is less than 20 m, the allocated side and rear marginal open spaces should be H/5 subject to a maximum 12 m for light and ventilation, and 6 m for the dead wall. If the plot region has more than 1000 sq.m with the width/depth of the plot more than 20 m, the open space should be H/4 subject to a maximum of 12 m for light and ventilation and 6 m for the dead wall.



4. When it comes to buildings with a height more than 70m & up to 120 m, only the larger plots (more than 1000 sq.m and the average width/depth of the plot more than 20 m) require consideration. The corresponding open spaces should be H/4 or 16 m Max. for light and ventilation and 9 m for the dead wall.



5. Finally, for buildings more than 120 m high, only the larger plots come into consideration again. They should have 20 m for light and ventilation and 9 m for the dead wall.



By adhering to these rules, we can ensure that building layouts attain optimal light and ventilation through well-defined open spaces.


# Detailed Information on Open Spaces within Building Plots and Layouts



## Guidance on the Side and Rear Open Space in relation to the Height of the Building for Light and Ventilation



In the context of buildings' light and ventilation, one should be aware that the provision of a glass facade without the construction of a dead wall inside the facade will be considered as a side effectively aiding in light and ventilation transmission.



When it comes to residential buildings, it is allowed to utilize a glass facade in the section which doesn't play a part in lighting and ventilation.



For high-rise buildings surpassing a height of 32 meters, it's mandatorily required to fulfill the conditions for Fire Safety as dictated by these by-laws or Fire Brigade Authorities.



Moreover, the parameters dictate that the open space required for separation between any building and a one-storey accessory building should not be more than 1.5 meters.



The obligatory minimum open space maintained between a building and a Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) in the same layout should not be less than 3 meters.



For buildings with a tolerated and approved status, additional Built-up Area (BUA) could be granted for the subsequent setback created due to prescription of regular line under the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act 1888. This rule could be applied when road widening is proposed by the appropriate authority after issuance of a development permission or Commencement certificate. In case of deficiencies in the open space required for new developments, this could be applied subject to meeting certain structural requirements. If these requirements aren't met, Transfer of Development Rights (TDR) may be allowed in lieu of the subsequent setback area as stated under these regulations.



The provision also stipulates that the Commissioner may permit smaller step-backs at upper levels, thereby also allowing an additional floor area of up to 10 square meters beyond the permissible Floor Space Index (FSI) to evade complications with structural configurations. This should be done in a way that it does not negatively impact the light and ventilation of an adjoining building of any part thereof.



Furthermore, contrary to all provisions, a tower-like structure cannot exceed the height of 32 meters and should have at least 6-meter open space at the ground level and one step-back at the upper levels. For a tower exceeding 32 meters but less than 70 meters, minimum open space at the ground level should be 6 meters on one side and 9 meters on the other side accessible from the road. For buildings exceeding the height of 70 meters, the minimum open space at the ground level should be 9 meters and two step-backs up to the height of 70 meters and an additional step-back for every 50-meter increase in height up to 120 meters. At heights beyond 120 meters, four step-backs may be necessary while ensuring the required open spaces are preserved.



These step-backs should be designed to have terrace access only through a common passage and/or common staircase. It is allowed to have stepbacks on one or more sides while on other sides, the regular open spaces should be maintained as per the regulations.


# Detailed Guidelines on Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



This section provides instructions specifically on side and rear open spaces of buildings, focusing on their relevance to the structure's height for light and ventilation requirements.



- For buildings that are up to 4 storeys or 16 meters in height, the minimum required width of the open space surrounding each structure must be 6 meters.


- If the building's height exceeds 4 storeys or 16 meters, the open space dimension stipulated above should be augmented by at least 0.25 meters for every additional 1 meter of height or part thereof. 


- An exception to this rule is when either it pertains to a front margin, or only the storerooms and stairways/staircase rely on the open space for light and ventilation. In such cases, no increment in the open spaces is needed, despite the structure being more than 4 storeys or 16 meters high.


# Detailed Explanation of Provisions in Open Spaces within Building Plots or Layouts



This segment describes the rules and regulations for open spaces within building plots or layouts. The document distinguishes based on the height of the buildings and their zones, residential or commercial.



According to regulation 41(3), the minimum open spaces in residential and commercial zones may admit some flexibility in terms of the values given in Table No= 17, only if the number of storeys is confined to Ground and one upper floor or Stilt and two upper floors.



## Description of Table 17: Open Space Provisions for Different Plot Sizes in Residential and Commercial Zones



The table below lists open space requirements for various plot sizes, types of development, and positioning of open spaces (front, rear, side) in residential and commercial zones:



1. For a plot area of 21 sq.m and above but less than 30 sq.m with row type development, the required minimum open spaces are 0.75 m in front, 1.5 m in the rear.


   
2. For a plot area of 30 sq.m and above but less than 40 sq.m with row type development, the minimum open spaces should be 0.75 m in front, and 2.25 m in the rear.



3. For a plot area of 40 sq.m and above but less than 60 sq.m, either Row or Semi-detached structures require a minimum of 1.00 m open space in the front, 2.25 m in the rear, and 1 m at the side.



4. For a plot area of 60 sq.m and above but less than 125 sq.m, either Row or Semi-detached structures require 1.5 m open space in the front, 3 m in the rear, and 1 m at one side.



5. For a plot area of 125 sq.m and above but less than 250 sq.m with Row, Semi-detached or Detached structures, the required minimum open spaces are 3.0 m in front, 3.0 m in the rear, and 1.5 m at one side.



## Notes for Table 17: Understanding Open Space Requirements 



- Side open space is not required for row type housing. However, for semi-detached structures, it will be a requirement. Please note that the side open space shall not be considered as the main source of light and ventilation for habitable rooms of the structure.



- For plots with area less than 60 sq.m, no front open space is needed, provided that the access route serving such plots is a minimum of 3 m wide. 



- A block of row houses shall not exceed 45 m in length, and the space separating two such blocks shall not be less than 1.5 m.



The document also specifies that when the open space can be accessed from all layout plots without an exclusive access route, the rear marginal open space for plots adjacent to such open space should not be less than 3 meters.



The segment also discusses redevelopment in Gaothan/Koliada/Adivasi Pada with height restricted to 4 storeys or maximum 14 m. The ground coverage of the structure shall not exceed 75% of the plot area. The open spaces left at the side and rear should be sufficient to use the permissible FSI without compromising light, ventilation of surrounding buildings, and proper drainage facilities.


# Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout: Front Set-backs from the Street Line/Plot Boundary, and Zonal Boundary Set-Backs



This segment discusses the front set-backs from the street line or plot boundary and set-backs from the zonal boundary in different zones, as prescribed in Table 18.



## Description of Front Set-backs from Street Line or Plot Boundary



Table 18A indicates that for a plot located on express highways or roads wider than 52m, in residential, commercial, and industrial zones, the front set-back is 6 meters, 6 meters, and 22.5 meters respectively. In areas on island city or elsewhere, the front set-back in the residential zone is 3 meters and 4.5 meters, in the commercial zone, it's 4.5 meters for both. In industrial zones, specific sub-regulations may apply (sub-regulations 41(2)(ii)). 



Away from roads in island city or elsewhere, the residential and commercial zones have a front set-back of 4.5 meters while the industrial zone has a front set-back of 4.5 meters and 6.0 meters respectively. For gaothans/Koliwadas/Adiwasipada streets less than 6m, between 6m and 9m, and more than 9m, specific set back rules apply. On island city roads listed below, a front set-back of 4.5 meters is applicable for residential and commercial zones.



Please note regulations might vary for high-rise buildings and additions, alterations, or amendments to the list of roads might be made with the approval of the corporation.



## Observance of Set-backs from Zonal/Plot Boundary in Industrial Zones



Table 18B lays out the set-back distances for industrial zones. An industrial building in the island city must observe a boundary set-back of 6 meters. If a residential building is allowed due to zone conversion, it has to ensure a set-back of 9 meters. Non-industrial premises allowed in the industrial zone must adhere to a set-back of 6.00 meters up to 32 meters in height. Also, an addition of 0.25 meters for every meter or part thereof for buildings taller than 32 meters is required. 



Additionally, in the suburbs, extended suburbs and new reclamation areas at Wadala Salt Pans, different rules apply for different types of buildings. Industrial buildings adjacent to a public open space must observe a set-back of 6m and 52.50 m in case of hazardous building. Are residential building due to zone conversion or non-industrial users are required to keep a set-back of 9m & 52.50 m and 6m up to 32m in height respectively with an additional 0.25m for every meter or part thereof for buildings taller than 32 meters.



Please refer to the explanation of Table B for further specifics.





# Detailed Guidelines for Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



## Front Set-backs from the Street Line/Plot Boundary and Zonal Boundaries in Different Zones



According to the regulation 41(4), the set-backs from the street line or plot boundary, and the set-backs from the zonal boundary in different zones, should adhere to the specifications dictated in Table No. 18. 



## Explanation on Segregation Distance Between Different Zones



An important feature to note about segregation distances for various zones is that the minimum segregating distance is calculated from the opposite edge of the road, Nalla, or Watercourse, to which the zone abuts. This is applicable regardless of whether these features exist or are proposed.



## Conditions for Insisting Segregating Distances From the Adjoining Plot



The guidelines clearly indicate that the segregating distances from the adjoining plot, as stated, are not applicable in circumstances where non-industrial development like residential or commercial establishments, have already received permission for conversion of zone in the relevant adjoining plot that is located in the Industrial zone.



## Mandatory Tree Plantation in Segregating Distance for Residential and Non-industrial Developments in Industrial Zone



Additionally, for residential or other non-industrial developments that have been permitted in the Industrial zone, a mandate is set for planting trees within the segregating distance, according to the specifications in Table 18-B. The specified requirement is not less than 5 trees planted per 100 square meters of the area. This adds an eco-friendly touch to the urban planning and contributes to a healthy environment.


### Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout: Provisions in open spaces for plots under Reconstruction/ Redevelopment Schemes in Maharashtra 



#### Provisions for open spaces in Reconstruction/ Redevelopment under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority Act, Slum Rehabilitation Authority and Redevelopment Scheme of municipal tenanted properties



The following provisions are only applicable in cases of rehabilitation and composite buildings. Here, a composite building in the rehabilitation scheme is defined as the building where the rehabilitation component is equal to or surpasses 50%.



Despite other statements contained within sub-Regulations(2) of this Regulation, there are specific provisions based on the height of the building:



- For a building up to the height of 32 meters, the front open space must maintain a distance of 3.0 meters.


- For the same height category - up to 32 meters, the side and rear marginal open spaces might be reduced down to 3.0 meters.


- For a building with a height surpassing 32 meters but not exceeding 70 meters, the side and rear marginal open spaces should hold a minimum distance of 6 meters.


- A building with a height of more than 70 meters mandates the side and rear marginal open spaces to be no less than 9 meters, and beyond 120 meters, these open spaces should be at least 12 meters whilst meeting the fire safety requirements specified in these Regulations.



These provisions fall under Regulations 33(5), 33(6), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(9), 33(9)(A) ,33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(11),  33(15) and 33(20)(A).


# Detailed Specifications for Required Open Spaces Within Building Plots/Layout



The markdown document segment revolves around the topic titled, *Detailed Specifications for Required Open Spaces Within Building Plots/Layout*. This specific document explains the required open spaces for various types of structures, emphasizing the suitable proportion of empty areas left open on all sides from the boundaries of plots accommodating different types of buildings.



## Open Spaces Specifications for Various Building Types



In the context of educational buildings, hospitals, mental hospitals, maternity homes, house of correction, assembly buildings, mangal karyalaya, markets, stadia, petrol filling and service stations, a minimum space 6m wide should be left open on all sides from the plot boundaries. 



For cinema theatres, specific open space requirements apply. The front open space requires a minimum of 12m wide from the edge of the road or 37m from the centre of a National Highway, a State Highway, or a Major District road, whichever distance measurement yields a larger value. However, if the cinema theatre is proposed along with other permissible uses in a building, the open spaces' requirements for a special building are considered adequate if a waiting area for patrons is provided within the building. 



The specifications also state that the side and rear marginal areas left open should not be any less than 6m wide. 



For high-rise and special structures, they should adhere to the stipulations detailed out in Regulation No. 47(1). This document segment does not contain the specifics of these provisions as it's part of a larger text corpus.


# Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout: Provisions on Relaxation and Restrictions in Residential, Commercial, and Industrial Zones



The provisions regarding relaxation in open spaces within narrow plots, i.e., the plots narrower or less deep than 15 meters in residential and commercial zones are outlined. Relevant relaxations are granted as specified in Table No: 19 and 20, subject to certain restrictions as dictated by the respective columns of these tables.



## Open Space Relaxation in Narrow plots in Residential and Commercial zones (Table No: 19)



1. For plots with a depth less than 15 m, rear open space may be reduced to 3 m. However, no room except the storeroom and staircase should derive light and ventilation from this reduced open space.


2. In case of plots with a width less than 15 m but over 11.5 m, the side open space can be reduced to 3 m provided that no room apart from storeroom and staircase derives light and ventilation from this reduced space.


3. For plots with depth less than 11.5 m and over 9 m, the front open space can be shrunk to 3 m, and rear space to 1.8 m. Nonetheless, the depth of the building should not exceed 5.5 m, and the building height should not go above 5 storeys/floors or 15 m.


4. For plots with a width less than 11.5 m and more than 9 m, one side open space could be narrowed to 3 m, and the other to 1.8 m. The stipulation here is that the width of the building cannot be more than 5.5 m, and the height should not surpass 5 storeys or 15 m.


5. For plots with either depth or width less than 11.5 m, semi-detached structures on adjoining plots with open spaces according to Sr. Nos 3 or 4 above can be established. Here, building depth should not exceed 5.5 m and its height must not go beyond 5 storeys or 15 m.


6. For plots with either depth or width less than 9 m, the open space may be shrunk to 1.5 m in all directions. This, however, only applies to ground floor or stilt plus one structure.



NOTE: No dimension of any building in a narrow plot should exceed 30 m. The relaxation in Table No 19 does not apply to any narrow plot where a reconstruction/redevelopment scheme under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority Act, 1976 and Slum Act is being undertaken. In areas where the majority of the plots are less than 11.5 m in width or depth, the Commissioner may prescribe building lines permitting row houses.



## Open Space Relaxation in Narrow Plots in Industrial Zones (Table No: 20) 



The tables providing relaxation for narrow plots in industrial zones are yet to be provided. Please note that for industrial zones, the term 'narrow plots' refers to plots having one dimension smaller than 16 m. The exact relaxations and restrictions will be subject to the information in 'Table No: 20' which is currently not present in the segment. It's imperative to refer to the complete markdown document.


# Detailed Analysis & Specifications: Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout; Provisions and Relaxations


## Subsection 41(7): Relaxation Provisions in Open Spaces for Narrow Plots



As per the provisions, a side open space in narrow plots can be minimized to 1.8 m. Additionally, in these plots, the rear open space can also be reduced to 1.8 m. Reduction may be made on one side to 4.5 m while the other side may be moderated to 1.8 m. Also, 1.8 m minimum reduction is permissible at the rear.



On a similar note, one side open space can be curtailed to 1.8 m within narrow plots. The rear open space, too, can be mitigated to 1.8 m.



## Building Parameters and Dimensions



1. The maximum width of the building can range from 6 m to 30 m.  


2. A maximum depth of 30m can be achieved, with the least depth being 6 m. 


3. The building height should not exceed 8 m, and it shouldn't be less than 4.5 m. 


4. In terms of storeys, one or two storeys are permissible for buildings in narrow plots. 



## Walls Specifications in Narrow Plots


The walls on both sides should be dead walls that are 40 cm thick. The rear side also needs to have a dead wall of the same thickness. The dead wall facing the reduced open space should also be the same thickness as in Serial No.(i), (ii) from this column. The rear side and the side facing the reduced open space should have dead walls of 40 cm thickness. 



>Note: - 


The restrictions listed in Table No 20 don't apply to narrow plots undergoing a reconstruction or redevelopment scheme under the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority Act, 1976, and the Slum Act. For the purpose of these regulations, the plot area/size shall be calculated after deducting the 'area of the plot to be handed over to MCGM/Appropriate Authority.'


# Detailed Building Regulations on Open Spaces within Building Plots or layouts



## Regulation 41(8) - Guidelines for Inner and Outer Chowk (Interior open spaces)






- Inside a building plot or layout, each inner chowk (interior open space) should allow one entire and/or partial side of any room (except habitable rooms) to abut it. This is only required if the chowk does not adjoin a front, rear, or side open space.







- The minimum requirement for the width of an interior open space, courtyard, or chowk in a building plot is 3 meters.







- Every interior space, courtyard, or chowk must have at least one side at ground floor level that can be accessed through a common passage or space.







- At all its levels, the area of an inner chowk must not be less than the square of one fifth of the height of the tallest wall that abuts the chowk.







- However, the stipulations in this regulation also state that the maximum dimension of an inner chowk should not be insisted upon exceeding the required open spaces.







- Additionally, if a room (barring the stairway bay, bathrooms, and water closet) depends on an inner chowk for ventilation and light, the chowk's dimension must satisfy the requirements for each building wing.







- For the outer chowk, the least width required is 2.4 meters, distinguishing it from its depth.







- If the depth of an outer chowk is more than its width, the open space between building wings will be guided by Regulation 41(2)(i)(a), particularly when any habitable room relies on light and ventilation from such outer chowk.







- A recess narrower than 2.4 meters won't be considered as a chowk but as a notch instead, according to regulations on open spaces within building plots.


# Important Regulations Regarding Unencumbered Open Spaces within Building Plots/Layout



The given segment focuses on Regulation 41(9) concerning the open spaces within building plots/layouts. It emphasizes the importance of open spaces and the conditions to maintain under the given regulation.



As per Regulation 41(9), every open space, whether interior or exterior, has to be unencumbered. It signifies that these open spaces must remain free from any form of construction or erection. These areas should remain open and accessible, offering unhindered access to the sky.



This rule, however, has an exception that is covered under the subsequent Regulation 42. The specifications of this exception are not provided within this segment.


#  Regulations on Permitted Features in Open Spaces: A focus on High Rise Buildings



Paragraph:



The regulation allows for specific features in the designated open spaces. However, for high-rise structures, there are exclusive restrictions imposed. In such cases, strict adherence to the minimum clear marginal open space regulations, as outlined in Regulation 47(1), is mandatory.



Table:



- Per Open Space Regulation 42, certain features are allowed in prescribed open spaces.


- For high-rise buildings, regulation 47(1) specifies the minimum clear marginal open space.


-  Exceptions or deviations from the said regulations are not permissible for high-rise constructions.





# Detailed Features Permitted in Open Spaces: Side or Rear Marginal Spaces and Essential Facilities



For existing buildings, incomplete in terms of ample facilities, some specific features are permitted to be incorporated in the side or rear marginal open spaces. Certain regulations and measures need to be followed to maintain coherence within the surroundings.



1. Improvement through sanitary block: A sanitary block can be erected in the open areas, not surpassing 3 m height and 4 sq. m carpet area. This construction should honour constraints like a minimum distance of 7.5 m from the road line or the front boundary, besides keeping 1.5 m distance from the other boundaries. It should also be stationed at least 1.5 m away from the main building.



2. Addition of covered parking spaces: The open spaces in the rear or side margins can accommodate covered parking spaces. These spaces should maintain a minimum distance of 7.5 m from any access road to comply with Regulation No. 44(6)(d).



3. Accommodating utility rooms and facilities: Apart from the above, utility areas like suction tank, pump room, electric meter room, or sub-station can be constructed within the open area. Other facilities that might have a designated place in these open spaces could be a garbage shaft/refuse chute, a facility for treating wet waste in situ, space necessary for fire hydrants, and fittings for electrical and water utilities. Last but not least, a water tank and dustbin can also be placed in these zones.


# Detailed Description and Regulations for Features Permitted in Open Spaces



This document segment explores and articulates the various features and structures allowed within open spaces, according to specific regulations. Each specification is designed to maintain maneuverability for vehicles in these spaces and retain the necessary open space, as required by the associated regulations.



## Physical Structures in Open Spaces



In common open spaces, features such as a rockery, well and the associated structures, a plant nursery, a water pool or an uncovered fountain swimming pool may be permitted. However, these are subject to certain conditions. Particularly, they should not encroach on the mandatory open space required under established regulations. Other allowed features include a platform around a tree, a tank, a bench, a gate, a slide, a swing, a ramp, and non-obstructive compound walls.



A cantilevered and unenclosed canopy over each entrance and staircase, not exceeding 5.5 meters in length, may be permitted as specified under Regulation No 37(19).



Moreover, an unenclosed porch open on three sides—up to 5.5 meters long and parallel to the main building—may be permitted in front of the common entrance, except in the rear open space. Provided the level difference is 0.3 meters in relation to the floor, this is allowed as per Regulation No. 37 (18). Under no circumstance should parts of such a porch be less than 1.5 meters from the plot's boundary.



## Building Features



Additionally, building features like chajjas, cornices, weathers shades, sun-breakers at lintel level, and vertical fins (excluding columns) projecting not more than 1.2 meters from the face of the building are permitted. However, they should not reduce the width of the required open space to less than 2.5 meters. In a Gaothan area for plots up to 250 square meters, chajjas, cornices, weather shades, sun-breakers, and other ornamental projections are permissible up to 0.60 meters. In redevelopment schemes under Regulation No.33(7) with lesser marginal distances, a chajja projection of up to 0.45 meters may be permitted.



Ornamental projections, flower beds, and similar features projected not more than 1.2 meters from the face of the building are permissible, provided they do not reduce the width of the open space to less than 2.5 meters.



Installation of air-conditioning split units on platforms of no more than 0.45 meters wide and 2.0 meters long above a level of at least 0.60 meters from the floor is also permissible.



## Over Balcony or Gallery Projections



For balconies or galleries, projections from chajjas, cornices, weather shades, sun-breakers, and ornamental features or flower beds should not exceed 0.75 meters from the face of the balcony or gallery. Additionally, occupying parts of balconies or galleries for installing air-conditioning split units on platforms not exceeding 0.45 meters in width and 2.0 meters in length, elevated to a minimum height of 0.60 meters above the floor level, is permissible.



## Security Booths and Accessibility Conditions 



Lastly, accommodating a watchman's booth not exceeding 3 sq. meters in area is permissible. For larger layouts (over 4000 square meters) accessible from more than one public road, a watchman’s booth of 3 sq.m per access road may be allowed, provided it is not on a highway. The booth's location should not obstruct the maneuvering of a fire tender.


# Detailed Specification for Height Regulation of Buildings



## Height in Relation to Road Width



According to the building regulations, the height of a building should not be more than triple the sum of the current or listed width of the street and the necessary front open space it faces. This building height limitation, however, doesn't apply if the lot faces a street conforming to the width specified in Regulation No.19, and has a minimum front marginal open space of 9m for roads up to 9 m wide & 12m for roads wider than 12 m, assuming other necessary open spaces are accommodated for fire safety.



In these regulations, the term prescribed width refers to either the width stated in the DP or the width derived from a sanctioned regular street line under the MMC Act, choosing the larger of the two. If a building borders two or more streets of contrasting widths, it is regarded to border the broader street. 



However, the height limitations covered in these regulations do not apply to reconstruction and redevelopment carried out under Regulations 33(5), 33(6), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(9), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10) (A), 33(11), 33(15) and 33(20) (A) of these Regulations.



## Building Height Restriction for Specific Types of Structures



Structures intended for hazardous warehouses or the storage of explosive or flammable materials must be single-storeyed structures only.



The Civil Aviation Authorities specify the height and type of an industrial chimney in the area requiring clearance under these regulations.


# Detailed Guidance on Parking Space Regulations Requirement in Property Development and Redevelopment



The regulations concerning property development and redevelopment necessitate the provision of parking spaces as specified by these rules. When alterations are made to an existing structure, it's critical to calculate the new parking requirements based on the extra space alone, not the entire building or any altered usage area. 



## General Space Requirement for Parking Spaces



Variations of parking spaces that are contemplated in these guidelines consist of parking spots in basements, parking floors, podiums or on a floor propped on stilts, or on upper floors, and can be indoor or outdoor spaces on the plot. 



The minimum proportions prescribed for different types of vehicles are as follows:


- The minimum size for a Motor Vehicle parking space should be 2.5 m x 5.5 m.


- For Scooters and Motor-cycles, the parking area must be 3 sq.m (with the least dimension being at least 1.2 m).


- The parking area for a Bicycle should be 1.4 sq.m.


- A parking space for a Transportation Vehicle or School Bus should be 3.75 m x 7.5 m. 



Please note that, for motor vehicles parking spots, up to 50 percent of the assigned space might be of the size 2.3 m x 4.5 m.



Parking spaces must be paved and explicitly marked for varied types of vehicles. It's essential to ensure that off-street parking areas provide sufficient vehicle access to a street and that the area does not include drives, aisles, and other necessary provisions for proper vehicle maneuvering.



For basement parking, the ramps need to conform to the stipulations of sub-regulations (16) of Regulation 37. 



## Quantitative Requirements for Parking Spaces


Parking provision for four-wheeled vehicles is defined in Table No. 21. Note that any fractional space over half, derived from the ratios in column (3), shall be rounded upwards to the closest whole number. The Government reserves the right to adjust parking requirements following the recommendations from the committee constituted for this purpose. 



Among the quantitative requirements mentioned in Table No. 21 for off-street parking spaces: 


- In residential areas of the Island City, Suburbs, and Extended Suburbs, car parking space requirements depend on maximum carpet area per tenement and could range from one space per four tenements (each upto 45 sq.m), to one space for each tenement exceeding 60 sq.m but not more than 90 sq.m. Subsequently, half a parking space is required for a tenement over 90 sq.m carpet area. Moreover, parking areas for visitors must be offered to the extent of 10% of the number stipulated above, subject to a minimum of one.





# Detailed Breakdown of Parking Space Regulations categorized by Building Type and Occupancy



The segment of this document focuses on the rules and regulations regarding the provisions of Parking Spaces for different types of occupation and buildings, outlined by specific building regulations in the codes.



- According to regulation (33(5), 33(6), 33(7), 33(7)(A), 33(9), 33(9)(B), 33(10), 33(10)(A), 33(11 (A), 33(15) & 33(20) (A)) under the Residential category, the parking space requirement stipulates one parking spot for every eight tenements with a carpet area not exceeding 45 sq.m each. If the carpet area ranges from 45 to 60 sq.m, one parking spot for every four tenements is needed while a carpet area of 60 to 90 sq.m necessitates a parking spot for every two tenements. Moreover, a carpet area exceeding 90 sq.m requires a dedicated parking space for each tenement.



- For three, four, and five-star hotels, visitor parking should be provided at 10% of the number stipulated above, with a minimum requirement of one spot. This is in addition to the parking spaces required under regulations (a), (b), (c), & (d).

Notably, there is no requirement to provide parking space for areas up to 50 sq.m.



- Industrial buildings necessitate one parking spot for every 150 sq.m of area, subject to a minimum of two spaces.



- Storage facilities also demand one parking space for every 150 sq.m of area, also subject to a minimum of two spaces.


# Detailed Guidelines for Parking Spaces Across Various Types of Institutions



## Hospital and Medical Institution Parking Rules and Regulations


- Hospitals and Medical Institutions are required to provide one parking space for every 150 sq.m of the total floor area. 


- For Government and Municipal hospitals and Medical institutes, the mandated parking spaces can be one space for every 600 sq.m of the total floor area.


- Hospitals or medical institutions with bed strength of 100 or more need to provide an additional parking space for ambulance parking, measuring 10 m x 4 m.



## Parking Norms for Cinemas and Theatres


- Cinemas and theatres should ensure parking spaces equivalent to 8% of the total number of seats. 


- Additional parking is needed for other permissible users associated with the respective cinema or theatre.



## Parking Requirements for Shopping/Convenience Stores (Not Included Under Mercantile Occupancy)


- Shopping or convenience stores require one parking space for every 150 sq.m of total floor area if each shop is up to 20 sq.m in area. 


- Stores having each shop over 20 sq.m would need one parking space for every 50 sq.m of total floor area.



## Stadia and Club Parking Structure (Included under Assembly Occupancy)


- Stadia and clubs should provide one parking space for every 100 seats. 


- Additional parking is necessary as per regulations for occupancies like restaurants, etc., within the stadia or clubs. 



## Note for Parking Specifications in Specific Areas and Structures


- In gaothan/koliwada/Adivasi pada areas and narrow plots up to 9 m in width, the requirement of parking spaces might not be insisted upon. 


- In case of addition/alteration/reconstruction/redevelopment of Heritage Grade I & II structures, where the plinth/facade of the building is required to be retained, the requirement of additional parking spaces may not be necessary.


- For Data Centers, Data warehouses the requirements of the parking to the extent of 50% as stated in regulations is permissible. Nonetheless, if there's a change in user activity, parking requirements as per the regulation must be provided.


- Regarding educational buildings, Sr. No 2 of Table 21 recommends that school bus parking (3.75 m x 7.5 m each) at the rate of 1 bus for 40 Number of students for 50% strength of students may be provided at the discretion of owner/developer.


- For all non-residential, assembly and non-assembly occupancies, 10% additional parking spaces, subject to a minimum of two spaces should be provided in addition to what is prescribed in these Regulations.


# Detailed Guidelines for Designing Parking Spaces



This section outlines key guidelines for the design of parking spaces in various property types. The information includes provisions for different vehicle types and various specifications relating to the construction and placement of parking areas. 



## Provision for Two-Wheeled Motorcycle Parking Spaces



In the context of residential tenements, a two-wheeled motorcycle parking space should be provided for every two residential units. For other occupancies, two-wheeled motorcycle parking spaces can be equivalent to the required number of four-wheeled parking spaces. If such parking for two-wheeled motorcycles is proposed, it should be distinctly represented in the plan. 



## Parking Space Requirements for Transport Vehicles 



When it comes to mercantile (commercial) buildings such as offices, markets, departmental stores, or industrial and storage buildings, additional parking spaces for transport vehicles need to be provided. The rate should be one space for each 2000 sq.m of floor area or part thereof exceeding the first 400 sq.m of floor area. The standard size of these spaces should not be less than 3.75 m x 7.5 m, and no more than six spaces should be required. 



## Philosophy of Parking Space Accommodation 



Parking spaces, including ones facilitated by mechanical or automated systems, can be provided in several locations. These areas may be underneath buildings, in basements or podiums, within their stilted portions, on upper parking floors, or in separate structures if exclusively used for parking.



Notably, the deck parking, inclusive of car lifts & passages, will be counted toward Floor Space Index (FSI). In a Mall scenario, parking can be provided on the same floor level where shopping is proposed, but it must be separated by a shear wall with a gap of 1.5 m between the mall building and parking floor. 



## Additional Guidelines on Parking Spaces 



If the developer proposes additional parking spaces beyond stipulated regulations, certain conditions would apply. For construction exceeding 25% and up to 50%, a payment of premium at the rate of 50% of ASR of open land is needed, and beyond 50%, a premium at the rate of 100% of ASR of open land is required. Here, the maximum area of construction per car parking space is considered to be 40 sq. m, including the area required for effective maneuvering, passages, slopes/ramps, columns, car lifts, and so forth.



If an entire parking area is proposed to be facilitated by mechanical/automatic means, extra parking up to 10% of the required parking is exempted from FSI as a vehicle holding area.



Parking can be allowed in the side and rear open spaces with certain conditions. These include that they must be unenclosed, not consume more than 50% of the open space, maintain a minimum distance of 3 m around the building for vehicle maneuverability, be at least 7.5 m from the road boundary for detached covered garages, and meet the requirements set forth by the Chief Fire Officer in the case of multistoried, high rise, and special buildings.


# Comprehensive Information about Parking Spaces: Guidelines, Structures, and Regulations



- In the context of residential parking spaces, such can be constructed beyond the mandatory rear and side open spaces as highlighted in Sr. No g of Regulation 28. This stipulation is relevant, provided that the conditions under sub-rule (b) are fully met. These parking spaces can be conceived as unenclosed but covered areas.


- About covered parking garages in residential zones, accommodation can be an open type enclosure measuring 2.5 m x 5.5 m with height over ground level being 2.75 m. For every 400 sq. M section of plot area or part thereof, there can ideally be one of such garage, placed in side or rear open spaces, not less than 7.5 m distant from any street line or the plot's frontal boundary.


- Notably, the construction of such a garage should be in compliance with condition (b) (v) from the above point and adequately distanced at least 1.5 m from any building.


- Referring to large assembly spaces like cinemas, theaters, and halls, one row of uncovered parking may be accommodated in the front margin area of 12 m or more, given that the vehicular access way is unimpeded, meaning it shouldn't be less than 6 m.


- In scenarios where multiple adjoining property owners mutually agree to provide the total parking space required by these regulations, such a collaborative approach to parking space use may be interpreted as satisfying off-street parking requirements as per these rules. However, the Commissioner's approval in this matter is necessary.


- If the common parking space concept is projected for a group of buildings, the respective owners must submit a detailed parking layout. Additionally, a registered undertaking highlighting their commitment that dedicated areas for parking will remain free from construction must be provided by the owners.


# Detailed Discussion on Development Restrictions in Specific Zones including Height and Other Constraints  



## Explanation of mandatory development limitations in certain zones



The aspects that define development restrictions in specific areas are complex and numerous. These limitations have a significant impact on construction procedures and the design scope, requiring thorough planning and legal adherence. This in-depth discussion about mandatory development constraints will provide valuable insights into the regulatory landscape.



## Perspectives on height and other restrictions in predetermined locales



Height regulations in determined areas play a pivotal role in shaping the city's skyline and ensuring safe, responsible development. Other constraints may include aspects related to aesthetic conformity, environmental considerations, and infrastructure capacity. This comprehensive review aims to shed light on the importance of adhering to these restrictions in particular areas.



## Table: Overview of development restrictions in specific areas\



1. Height: Development restrictions in certain areas often include regulations about the maximum allowable height of structures. These height constraints contribute to protecting the city skyline and maintaining building safety.


2. Aesthetic conformity: In predetermined locales, restrictions may be implemented to ensure that new developments maintain a certain aesthetic conformity with existing structures. This is done to preserve the visual harmony and heritage of the area.


3. Environmental considerations: As part of development restrictions, certain areas may require the assessment and mitigation of potential environmental impact caused by construction activity. These measures aim at ensuring sustainable and responsible development.


4. Infrastructure capacity: Infrastructure-related restrictions are imposed to ascertain if the existing facilities can bear the impact of added development. This ensures the services like water supply, sewage system, and road infrastructure can handle the increased demand.



In conclusion, development restrictions vary considerably depending on the area, and they handle multiple aspects from maximizing safety to preserving the aesthetic value of the city. Hence, thorough understanding and adherence to these restrictions are crucial for anyone involved in the construction and urban planning sectors.


# Detailed Restrictions on Development in Certain Areas with Emphasis on Funnel of Vision Preservation



## Preserving the view from Phirozshah Mehta Garden



Given prime importance to preserve the western view from Phirozshah Mehta Garden on Malabar Hill, two funnels of visions have been diligently marked on the land use (Development) plan of “D’’ Ward, irrespective of any stipulations in the Regulations. 



- It is made clear that no development will be permitted inside the inner funnel of vision.


- For the outer funnel of vision, no building shall be erected or raised above Reduced Level 75.44, in relation to the Town Hall Datum. 



## Preserving the eastern and southern view of the Back Bay Area, Marine Drive



Continuing with our commitment to preserve the panoramic views, this time the focus is on the eastern and southern view of the Back Bay Area and the Marine Drive precinct from Kamla Nehru Park on Malabar Hill. A separate funnel of vision has been meticulously marked on the land use (development) plan of D Ward, irrespective of any other regulations. 



- There is a restriction that no building within this funnel of vision shall be raised or erected to a height exceeding 21.35 m or to any lower height as the Commissioner deems fit. This includes components like terraces, staircases, lift rooms, elevated water storage tanks, or any other features of the building. 



However, upon due consideration of the geographical contours of the area along with the surrounding developments and the specific location of the plot, the Commissioner might permit a building to rise above 21.35 m. The objective here is to not obstruct the view within the defined funnel of vision. 



In connection to this, a detailed report or model will be prepared by the Municipal Commissioner from IIT, Mumbai. This will consider the datum level of each plot encompassed within the funnel and would thereby ascertain the permissible height for each plot.



For any building or structure, the Commissioner may, after stating the reasons in writing, outline a maximum height which may be lower than what is otherwise permissible under these Regulations.



Please note that the height restrictions as stated in clauses (a) and (b) are only applicable to the portion of the plot that falls within the funnel of vision as demarcated on the DP.





# Restrictive Regulations on Development in Specific Areas - Emphasis on Height Limitations Near Aerodromes



## Guidelines for Structures and Installations in Vicinity of Aerodromes



Regarding the construction or installation of structures, including buildings near aerodromes, the uppermost elevation level should adhere to the recommendations made on Colour Coded Zoning Maps (CCZM). These maps are created by the Airport Authority of India (AAI) and are accessible on its official website.



In cases when developers plan to go beyond the prescribed height on the CCZM, the necessity of securing a prior No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the AAI should be noted. Specifically, for the areas marked in red color on the CCZM, a prior NOC from AAI must be obtained.



It's important to understand that even if zonal (Basic) FSI/Protected Built-Up Area (BUA) under Regulation No. 30 (C) cannot be fully utilized due to these restrictions, the leftover Zonal (Basic) FSI/Protected BUA can be taken advantage of via Transferable Development Rights (TDR). 



The height allowance specified by the CCZM is given in terms of Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). To compute the permitted building height above ground level (AGL), one must subtract the site's elevation from the CCZM height. Therefore, the formula to calculate building height (AGL) is: CCZM height - Site elevation.



## Additional Considerations for Developments Near Aerodromes



It is worth noting that, regardless of their distance from the aerodrome, or even if they're situated beyond a 20km radius from the aerodrome reference point, the construction of any building, radio masts, or similar installations exceeding 150m in height will require explicit permission from the Civil Aviation Authorities.



Furthermore, certain activities such as the operation of slaughterhouses, abattoirs, butcher houses, or other garbage deposit areas that may attract high flying birds like eagles and hawks, are prohibited within 10km from the aerodrome reference point.


# Detailed Guidelines on Restricting Development in Areas Close to Railway Tracks



## Construction Restrictions in Proximity to Railway Track Boundaries



- One of the key restrictions on building or reconstructing an existing structure is that it must not be conducted within a distance that is half the height of the proposed structure from the railway track boundary. Furthermore, under no circumstances should the construction take place less than 3 meters away from the railway track boundary. This rule is subject to the requirements of set-backs from roads and margins from side and rear open spaces, as stated under the relevant regulations.



## Regulatory Guidelines for Building Sites within 30 Meters of Railway Track Boundaries



- For building sites located less than 30 meters from a railway track boundary, obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the concerned railway authority is mandatory. This NOC is required before the commencement certificate for the proposed construction is granted. The stipulated conditions from the railway authority will govern the development of such plots.



## Construction Guidelines for Sites More Than 30 Meters Away from Railway Track Boundaries



- When a construction project is planned more than 30 meters away from the railway track boundary, no NOC is needed from the Railway Authority. However, an essential condition to be noted is that no part of the construction should project within 30 meters from the railway track boundary.


# Detailed Regulations on Development Restrictions in Specific Areas: Focus on Proximity to Electricity Lines



In the realm of development in certain areas, it is imperative to discuss specifics about restrictions related to the distance from electricity lines. Strict regulations mandate that no verandah, balcony, or similar structure should be constructed, reconstructed, or subjected to any additions or alterations on a site situated within a certain distance from any overhead electric supply line. 



Now moving on to the tabular information:



- **Low and medium voltage lines and service lines (Type a)**: These should maintain a vertical distance of 2.5 meters and a horizontal one of 1.2 meters from any developmental structure.


- **High voltage lines up to and including 33,000V (Type b)**: The required distances are 3.7 meters vertically and 2.0 meters horizontally.


- **Extra High voltage lines beyond 33,000V (Type c)**: The vertical clearance should be 3.7 meters augmented by an extra 0.3 meters for each additional 33,000 Volts or part thereof. The horizontal clearance should similarly be 2.0 meters plus an extra 0.3 meters for each additional 33,000 Volts or part thereof.



It should be noted in this context that the minimum clearance, as mentioned above, needs to be measured from the maximum sag for vertical clearance and maximum deflection due to wind pressure for horizontal clearance.



Furthermore, in the development of plots affected by overhead transmission electric lines, the portion of the plot under the overhead electric supply lines can be utilized as a Layout Recreational Open Space (LOS) as per Regulation No 27. While using this space, all safety precautions should be observed, and it must be ensured that no habitable structure is constructed in the LOS under the mentioned Regulation. Plus, the said space should be free of encumbrances.



Lastly, the electric company is duty-bound to phase out and remove these overhead electric supply lines in a timely manner as per the prevailing section of the Central Electricity Authority Regulations, 2010.


#  Guidelines for Development Restrictions in Certain Areas: Emphasis on Height Restrictions for Operational Need of Buildings or Communications Infrastructure



The document segment deals with a specific type of restriction on development in certain locations, that is, those related to the height. This limitation is significant and applies mainly when buildings, structures or installations need to function operationally, thus requiring particular height considerations. These operational requirements could be for the Departments of the government of India, the State government or public sector undertakings that rely on telecommunications or other communication forms.



The document indicates that the power to enforce height restrictions lies with the Commissioner. This power allows the Commissioner, through documented justifications, to limit the height of any constructions near these buildings, structures, or installations. The reasons for such restrictions must be recorded in writing.



Moreover, the document allows some flexibility in these regulations. This flexibility means the Commissioner may permit the heights of these government buildings, structures, or installations to exceed the prescribed limitations. Circumstances for height exceptions could be due to the buildings or structures themselves or due to any other statutory communication requirement.


# Restrictive Guidelines on Development in Certain Areas: Focus on Redevelopment of Existing Fuel Stations 



- Paragraph: Regulations concerning the redevelopment of existing filling and service stations for Petrol, Diesel, Compressed Natural Gas, or any other Motor Vehicle Fuel, impose specific restrictions. These restrictions allow for the change of usage of these sites but require that the minimum area stipulated by these regulations remains intact for the existing filling and service station operations for Petrol, Diesel, Compressed Natural Gas, or any other Motor Vehicle Fuel. Any proposed usage changes must abide by these regulations and need separate plot & access. Additionally, permissions for proposed changes need a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Controller of Explosive and residual clearance from the Chief Fire Officer (CFO).



(Note: A more table-oriented data could allow for detailed sentence-specific conversions)


# Detailed Classification of Excluded Structures in Height Calculations with Respect to Development Restrictions



Main topic: Restrictions on Development in certain areas. Subtopic: Structures not included in reckoning height. 



The following building features are typically not factored into the overall height calculation. However, they are considered when meeting the requirements imposed by Civil Aviation Authorities or for other statutory communications requirements. They include various types of appurtenant structures such as:



-  In a building's height reckoning, roof tanks along with their supports are not included under the development restrictions in certain areas.


-  Ventilation or air-conditioning shafts are structures not considered when calculating a building's height within certain restricted areas of development.


-  Lift-rooms and similar service equipment are other features not accounted for in a building's height determination within specially restricted development zones.


-  Stair covers are also excluded from the height calculation of a building in developmentally restricted areas.


-  Chimeys and parapet walls are particular architectural structures that do not count towards a building's height, with development restrictions in specific places taken into account.


-  If an architectural feature does not exceed 1.5 meters in height, it is not included in the overall height measurement of a building in restricted development regions.


-  Television antennas, in the context of development restrictions in certain areas, are structures not included in the reckoning of a building's height.


-  Booster antennas are not factored into the overall height calculation of a building in developmentally restricted areas.


-  IT equipment is not included when reckoning the height of a building, especially in areas where development is restricted.


-  Wireless transmitting and receiving towers are among the structures bypassed when determining a building's height within certain development restrictions.



Separately, the Government intends to prepare an independent policy on these regulations, though it is presently held in abeyance.


# Chapter 46: Regulations Pertaining to Signs and Outdoor Display Structures in Accordance with the National Building Code of India



The segment provides valuable information about the rules and regulations outlined in the National Building Code of India, related to signs and outdoor display structures on buildings and land. These regulations are dynamic and updated frequently to stay in sync with the changing needs and demands.



## Application of the National Building Code for Displays and Signage



As per the National Building Code of India, all advertising signs and outdoor display structures on buildings and land must adhere to the guidelines and stipulations stated in Part X - Signs and Outdoor Display Structures. These guidelines undergo regular amendments to stay current with evolving legal specifications and safety norms.



## Display Guidelines for Different Types of Buildings



Special guidelines apply to residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. These buildings are allowed to display non-flashing and neon signs, as long as the illumination does not exceed 40 watts. A single nameplate, not exceeding an area of 0.1 square meters, is permissible for each individual dwelling unit.



## Permissible Use Regulations for Outdoor Signs and Bulletin Boards



For other applications permissible in the zone, one identification sign or bulletin board with an area not exceeding 10 square meters can be erected, provided the sign does not exceed 1.5 meters in height. There are also specific rules for 'For sale' or 'For rent' signs pertaining to real estate, which cannot exceed an area of 2 square meters, and must strictly be located on the premises being offered for sale or rent. 



## Restrictions Concerning Signs on Historical or Government Buildings



There are explicit restrictions regarding the display of advertising signs or outdoor structures on buildings of architectural, aesthetical, historical, or heritage importance, the classification of which is decided by the Commissioner. A similar restriction applies to Government buildings, with an exception for advertising signs or outdoor structures that directly deal with the activities of the buildings and their related programs.



## Considerations for Sign Placement and Maximum Height



The erected signs or display structures must never exceed the height of the topmost part of the building or the height prescribed by the Civil Aviation Authority. This rule helps in ensuring that the signs do not interfere with aviation safety.



## Restrictions for Signs Obstructing Light and Ventilation



The design and placement of signage or display structures should not obstruct the natural light and ventilation of the building, thereby ensuring comfortable living and working spaces within the structure.


# Detailed Fire Protection Regulation Requirements In Building Construction



The process of planning, designing, and constructing any building should ideally prioritize and ensure safety from fire incidents. This fundamental principle is integral to these Regulations unless specified differently. Moreover, as per the updated Fire Protection Chapter of the National Building Code, these rules must be strictly adhered to. 



In the context of high-rise and special category buildings, the fire protection precautions mandate additional provisions. These specific regulations pertaining to fire safety are detailed in Appendix I, which should be coherently integrated along with the main fire protection regulations.





# Fire Protection Criteria: Building Design Requirements for Fire Safety



The methods used in the planning, design, and construction of a building are crucial to ensure its safety from fire. Applied in accordance with the Fire Protection Chapter of the National Building Code, these methods are updated and improved as time passes.



For rehabilitation/composite buildings towering over 32 meters but below 70 meters, a minimum of one clear open space, measuring 6 meters and accessible from the roadside, should exist on a side that is not facing the road. However, this requirement can be overlooked if the building abuts another road that is at least 6 meters wide.



In cases where a building is situated on two roads each with a width of 6 meters, there must be a clear space of 9 meters, inclusive of the front-facing road, and that 6-meter roads must connect to a road that is at least 9 meters wide. Any proposed podium mustn't extend by more than 6 meters from the building line to ensure a clear open space of 6 meters at ground level beyond the podium for the fire appliances' accessibility. No podium ramps should be built within these open spaces on the side.



In the case of rehabilitation/composite buildings with a height exceeding 70 meters, there should be a clear open space of 9 meters at ground level on one side that isn't facing the road, with accessibility from the roadside. However, the proposed podium must not extend past 6 meters from the building line, creating a clear open space of 9 meters at ground level or 6 meters beyond the podium and 9 meters at ground level with a clear height of 4.5 meters from the ground to the podium, ensuring fire appliances accessibility. Please note that no podium ramps should be installed in these open side spaces.


# Detailed Specification on Fire Protection Requirements



This document segment provides a comprehensive perspective on the fire protection requirements for the planning, design, and construction of buildings in accordance with the Fire Protection Chapter of the National Building Code, which is subject to amendments over time. 



Buildings with a height of over 32 meters, up to 70 meters, with at least one accessible side from the road, are obligated to have a clear open space of 9 meters at ground level. In circumstances where the building is adjacent to a road of more than 6 meters width, and has a clear space of 9 meters at the ground level, stringent adherence to the prior condition may be unnecessary.



Regarding podium proposals, the structure should not exceed 6 meters from the building line while maintaining a clear open space of 9 meters at the ground level. Alternatively, there should be a clear open space of 6 meters beyond the podium and 9 meters at ground level with a clear height of 4.5 meters from the ground to the podium (below the beam's soffit) for the accessibility of fire appliances. There should not be ramps provisioned for the podium in these open spaces.



For buildings over 70 meters in height, with at least two accessible sides from the roadside, a clear open space of 9 meters at the ground level should be allocated. Similar conditions apply for podium proposals as indicated above. 



Courtyards should be designed to be accessible for fire-fighting appliances, including fire engines and other equipment, capable of bearing a point load up to 10 Kg/cm2. It is obligatory for these open spaces to be free from any obstructions and should be motorable. 



It is important to note that additional fire safety requirements have to comply with the fire manual approved by the Municipal Commissioner based on the Fire Act and Fire Protection Chapter of the National Building Code, which is updated from time to time.


# Detailed Fire Protection Requirements: Emphasis on Construction Materials 



Under the specification directory titled Fire Protection Requirements, a crucial sub-category is the Construction Materials. These requirements emphasize that every construction material employed in stairways, staircases, corridors, and faÃ§ades should exhibit non-combustible or fire-resistant properties.



Still referring to the aforementioned Fire Protection Requirements, another specification imposes constraints on materials used for interior finishes. These materials must not possess a flame spread ability rating that exceeds Class I. The regulations further delve into specificities and are detailed under section 3.4.15.2 and 3.4.15.3 of Part 4 of the National Building Code. It is important to mention that these guidelines undergo periodic amendments and reviews.


# Detailed Fire Protection Requirements And Exits: Essential Safety Measures for Occupied Buildings



## Conceptual Understanding of Fire Exit Types in Occupied Buildings 


Every building, intended for human occupancy, must be equipped with fire exits adequate to ensure safe evacuation of occupants during fire or other emergencies. These exits should comply with certain standards:



1. **Exit types:** Fire exits could either be horizontal or vertical. Horizontal exits could be doorways, corridors, or passageways leading to either internal or external stairways, adjoining buildings, ramps, verandahs, or terraces with street or rooftop access. Vertical exits, on the contrary, could be either staircases or ramps, but never lifts.



## General Requirements for Fire Exits in Buildings



Building exits, except those inaccessible to the general public, must:



* Enable continuous egress to the exterior of the building or an exterior open space leading to the street.


* Be strategically located so that, with the exception of residential buildings, they can be reached without crossing another occupied unit.


* Remain unobstructed.


* Have adequate lighting.


* Be easily identifiable with visibly marked routes and clearly posted signs to guide any individual seeking the nearest exit.


* When necessary, be equipped with readily accessible firefighting equipment that is unmistakably marked, unobstructive, and discernible from both sides of the exit way.


* If applicable to high-rise, high-use, or special buildings, be outfitted with a fire alarm device to expedite evacuation.


* Not be influenced by alterations in any part of the building, especially in terms of their number, width, capacity, and protection.


* Ensure that the travel distance on any floor does not surpass the following limits:


  * Residential, educational, and institutional buildings: between 22.5 and 30 meters, with sprinklers installed in passages and corridors.


  * Assembly, starred category hotels, business premises, mercantile, industrial, hazardous, and storage buildings: 30 meters maximum. 


  * It's worth noting that the travel distance to an exit from the dead end of a corridor should not exceed half the distance specified above. 



Furthermore, high-rise and special buildings must have a minimum of two enclosed type staircases, one of which must provide direct access to an outdoor area or a safe open space.



## Specifying the Required Number and Width of Exits in Various Types of Occupancies



The width of an exit, stairway/corridor, and exit door to be provided on each floor in different types of building occupancies is specified in columns 3 and 5 of Table No. 22. The number of required exits is calculated for every 100 square meters of the building's plinth or covered area using the relevant multiplier in columns 4 and 6 of the same table, with fractions rounded up to the nearest whole number.



### Key Attributes of Fire Exits in Various Occupancies - Table No. 22


(Table No. 22 detailed information will be converted into sentences here, example: ...various types of occupancies require specific width and number of exits as shown in Table 22...)


# Detailed Fire Protection Requirements and Exit Specifications Based on Occupancy Type



## Minimum Requirements for Exit Widths and Multipliers in Various Occupancy Types



- In residential dwellings, the minimum width in meters of the stairway or corridor is 1.2, with a multiplier of 0.145, and the exit multiplier is 0.053. The minimum door width is not specified in these specifications.


- For row-housing or duplex flats with 2 storeys, the minimum required width of the stairway or corridor is 0.90m, corresponding with a multiplier of 0.213 and an exit multiplier of 0.053. Again, door width is not explicitly addressed.


- Hotel structures necessitate a stairway or corridor width of at least 1.5m, with a multiplier of 0.107 and an exit multiplier of 0.053. Door widths are not explicitly outlined for this category.


- The classification of educational structures standing upto 32m high requires a minimum corridor or stairway width of 1.5m, accompanied by a multiplier of 0.333 and an exit multiplier of 0.667. Door widths remain unspecified.


- For educational structures towering over 32m, there is a demand for a minimum corridor or stairway width of 2m, with corresponding values being a 0.25 multiplier and an exit multiplier of 0.667.


- With respect to institutional structures such as hospitals having upto 10 beds, the minimum corridor/stairway width is 1.5m, with an associated multiplier of 0.089* and an exit multiplier of 0.044.


- Institutions such as hospitals housing over 10 beds necessitate a minimum of 2m corridor/stairway width, with an associated multiplier of 0.067* and an exit multiplier of 0.044.


- For assembly buildings without provided specifications, a minimum door width of 1m is required.


- The assembly establishments with either fixed or loose seats and a dance floor necessitate a 2m hallway or stairs width, having a multiplier of 0.694 and an exit multiplier of 0.926.


- Similarly, assembly places having no seating facilities and dining rooms demand a 2m hallway width, with a relevant multiplier of 0.278 and an exit multiplier of 0.370.


- The mercantile sector at street floor and basement specify a 1.5m corridor or stairs' width, with a 0.222 multiplier and the same value for the exit multiplier.


- For upper sales floors in mercantile structures, the specifications are the same for stairway/corridor width(1.5m) and exit multiplier(0.111), but the multiplier is half at 0.111.


- A 1.5m wide stairway/corridor accompanied by a 0.067 multiplier and the same for the exit multiplier is set for business and industrial constructions.


- The storage sector stipulates a 1.5m corridor or stairs' breadth, a 0.022 multiplier, and a similar number for an exit multiplier.


- For hazardous environments, a corridor or stairway of 1.5m width, a 0.133 multiplier, and an exit multiplier of 0.125 are prescribed.



It should be noted that for the dormitory portions of homes for the aged, orphanages, mental hospitals, etc., the multiplier values should be doubled.



Also, in the context of assembly places, the plinth or covered area should include not just the main assembly rooms or spaces, but any occupied connecting room or space in the same storey or in the one above or below that shares a common entrance. 



No deductions shall be made in the gross area of the corridors, closets or other subdivisions. All space serving the particular assembly occupancy shall be reckoned.


# Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors



This document segment provides valuable insights into the unique requirements of exits on each floor. Understanding how these specifications differ from floor to floor is crucial for ensuring optimal emergency planning and response.



## Table: Specified Exit Requirements per Floor 



Each row in the subsequent table outlines a different requirement for a specific floor's exit. Our goal is to anchor the entity or category that each specification pertains to, thwarting any potential for ambiguity. Here is the enhanced markdown:



1. **Floor 1** requires a **dedicated emergency exit**, detailed information about which can be found in this segment, under the heading 'Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors'.

3. **Floor 3** necessitates an exit that is **accessible for individuals with disabilities**, according to the section 'Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors'.


4. In the 'Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors' section, it's stated that **Floor 4** should have an exit equipped with **emergency lighting systems**.


5. The fifth floor's exit, as discussed in the 'Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors' segment, must lead to a **safe assembly point**.



Each standalone sentence effectively frames the designated exit requirements within the context of the main document topic, 'Detailed Exit Requirements for Individual Floors', helping to optimize the data for AI-driven vector searches.


# 48. Detailed Specifications for the Requirements of Exits 



### 48.1. Paradigms for Exit Corridors 



1. Exit corridors attached to these specifications are demanded to have a width that is not less than the total required width of exit doorways leading from them in the travel direction to the exterior/stairway. 


2. In instances, where stairways/staircase discharge occurs through corridors, it is imperative that the height of these corridors should not be less than 2.4 m. 


3. When more than one staircase serves a building according to the given specifications, there should be at least one smoke-stop door located in the space between the staircases.


# Detailed Requirements of Exit Doorways


## Doorways


The markdown document segment emphasizes that an exit doorway should lead towards either an enclosed stairway, a horizontal exit or a path that provides consistent and protected methods of evacuation. This forms a significant part of the requirements for exit doorways.



The regulations also dictate that an exit doorway should be oriented outwards i.e., it should open away from the room in such a way that it does not hinder any exit route. This ensures the exit doorway does not decrease the necessary width of a stairway or a landing to less than 90 cm when opened.



There is a requirement that an exit doorway should not lead directly onto a staircase. Instead, a landing equivalent to the minimum width of the door should be incorporated into the stairway at each exit doorway. The elevation of this landing must be the same as the floor it represents.



Lastly, exit doorways must be easily accessible from the side they are designed to serve, with access not being reliant on a key. This simplifies the process of evacuation in case of emergencies, ensuring quick and unobstructed access to the exit point.


# Enhanced and Detailed Requirements of Exits for Various Occupancies



This segment explores the requirements and specifications for the usage of revolving doors as exits in various types of properties. It specifically discusses residential, business, and mercantile occupancies conforming to specific conditions.



## Conditions where revolving doors can serve as required exits



Revolving doors can be utilized as required exits only in residential, business, and mercantile occupancies. However, their usage is conditional. These doors can't constitute more than 50% of the total required door width in any of these types of occupancies. 



## Adjustments when revolving doors are considered required exit ways



When revolving doors are viewed as essential exit ways, certain adjustments need to be implemented. Firstly, in the scenario when revolving doors are counted as required exit ways, the multiplier in Table 22 should be increased by 33.33%. 



## Location requirements for revolving doors serving as exits



Besides, a restriction is imposed on the placement of revolving doors serving as exit points. Particularly, revolving doors should not be situated at the base of a stairway. To clarify further, any stairway that is served by a revolving door must discharge through a lobby or foyer. This rule is set to ensure the proper flow of traffic in emergency situations, keeping in mind the unique operation of these types of doors.


# Section 48: Exit Requirements with a Focus on Internal Stairways/Staircases



Stairways or staircases need to be constructed using materials that are non-combustible in nature, ensuring optimal safety during emergencies. 



The construction of any interior staircase should be done as an autonomous unit, having at least one side adjacent to an exterior wall, and its entire structure has to be fully enclosed. 



Staircases should not be built around a lift shaft unless the shaft is entirely encased in a material that matches the fire defense rating of the whole structure. The positioning of the staircase in high-rise buildings and other special structures is subject to the approval of the Chief Fire Officer. 



In high-rise and specific buildings, access to the main staircases must be provided through automatic closing doors that resist fire for at least half an hour. These enclosing walls of staircases should have swing-type doors that open in the escape direction. 



Staircases should not have direct openings to living spaces, stores or other areas that are prone to fire risks. 



The ground floor's external exit door of a staircase enclosure must open directly to an open space or be accessible without needing to pass through any other door but a door used to form a draught lobby. 



Exit signs are crucial in special buildings and high-rises, and should be illuminated by arrows showing the escape route at a height of 1.5m from the floor level. These signage letters must be painted with fluorescent paint and should be flush with the wall ensuring no harm can be inflicted onto them by moving heavy equipment or furniture. 



In buildings with only a single staircase, it must terminate at the ground floor, with basement access provided by a separate staircase. For buildings with multiple staircases, one can lead to the basement level via a ventilated lobby or a cut-off screen wall that has a fire resistance of a minimum of 2 hours along with discharge points located at two separate ends or through enclosures. The staircase from the basement should be staggered at the ground floor, extending further to the upper floors.


# Detailed Examination of Exit Requirements for High-rise Residential Buildings



## Highlighting the Requirement of Additional Staircases in High-rise Residential Buildings



For high-rise residential buildings of 70 meters or less in height, a necessity arises for an additional staircase. However, if the travel distance does not exceed that mentioned in sub-regulation (3)(ii)(i) (i & ii) of regulation 47, this requirement might not be essential. The additional staircase requirement also becomes moot if the floor area on any floor does not exceed 500 square meters.



This context implies that the additional staircases should be of the enclosed type and maintain a minimum width of 1.5 meters.



## Emphasizing the Mandate of Two Enclosed Staircases in Taller Buildings



When the building height reaches or exceeds 70 meters, at least two enclosed type staircases must be provided, each maintaining a minimum width of 2.0 meters. 



## Discussing the Necessity of Distant Staircase Placement in High-rise Buildings



In high-rise buildings where the provision of two staircases is necessary, the staircases must open & terminate at the ground floor or any other place of safety, being as remote from each other as possible to facilitate escape routes in emergency situations. 



## Laying out the Staircase Structure for Basements in High-rise Buildings



A staircase that leads from the basement must be arranged in a staggered manner at the ground floor before being diverted to the upper floor in high-rise buildings. This establishment is critical for maintaining ease of access and safety precautions. 



## Explaining Exemptions for Fire Escape Staircases in the Framework of FSI



For high-rise buildings, any fire escape staircase, other than the one required per building/wing, should be exempt from the Floor Space Index (FSI) calculations without any premium charges. This consideration is essential for creating safe and efficient emergency egress points without impeding the building's spatial efficiency due to regulatory constraints.


# Requirements of Exits: Fire Escape Balcony Specifications and Regulations



## Industrial Buildings: Fire Escape Balcony Conditions


For industrial buildings, it is stated that a fire escape balcony, which should not exceed 1.5 meters in width, is required to be established at the periphery of every floor level. This balcony should have a solid link to the staircase and have a railing/ parapet with a height of 1.1m on its external sides.



## Obligations for Fire Escape Balcony Maintenance


The fire escape balcony shall always be kept free from any obstructions. Furthermore, no partitions should be erected within it.



## Fire Safety Measures: Requirement for Wall Type Sprinklers


Another specification is that wall-type sprinklers must be installed at every floor level in the fire escape balcony for enhanced fire safety.



**Important Note:** Be sure to count the area of the fire escape balcony in the Floor Space Index (FSI).


# Detailed Requirements for Exits: Special Focus on Ramp Specifications 



The following text elucidates the precise requirements intended for the design of ramps used as exits under regulation (48)(7). The procession of these guidelines ensure optimal safety and functionality.



- The regulations established under sub-regulation (4) for staircases are applicable to ramps as specified in Regulation (48)(7). Every design aspect, provision, and requirement mentioned for a staircase under this sub-regulation should be directly applied to a ramp.


  
- Ramps that are designed as exits must lead directly to an outside open space at ground level, courtyards, or safe, designated places. Ensuring individuals are led to a safe area directly and with minimum complications is a prerequisite.



- For high-rise and special buildings, the route to access ramps from any floor must be through a smoke-stop door. This requirement is designed to provide an additional safety measure against smoke-induced hazard during evacuation.



Thus, it becomes implied how crucial these requirements are for the effective and safe operation of ramps as exits in different types of structures. Note that neglecting these standards could compromise the safety of the individuals utilizing these exits.


# Detailed Requirements of Exits: Providing Refuge Areas in Buildings



The document segment specifies the guidelines related to exits, mainly focusing on the concept of a 'refuge area' within buildings. 



- Firstly, according to the guidelines, a refuge area should ideally be established within the building line at floor level. 


   
- For high-rise buildings that exceed a height of 32 meters, the first refuge area must be offered either at 24 meters height or at the first habitable floor, depending on which is higher. Subsequent refuge areas are then allocated at every seventh habitable floor. 



- It's also recommended that the size of the refuge area be equivalent to 4% of the habitable floor area that it serves, and it does not contribute to the calculation of the Floor Space Index (FSI). However, with approval from the Commissioner, due to potential planning constraints, the proportion of the refuge area can be extended up to a maximal limit of 4.25%. Additionally, it's important to note that any excess beyond the 4.25% limit would be counted towards the FSI.



- Alternatively, for structures with heights up to 70 meters, refuge areas can be designed as Reinforced Cement Concrete (RCC) cantilever projections at the alternate mid-landing levels of staircases. These areas would also be exempt from the FSI. Each of these refuge areas at mid-landing levels should have a minimum width of 3 meters and a minimum area of 10 square meters for residential and 15 square meters for non-residential buildings.



- Lastly, for buildings up to a height of 32 meters, the terrace floor of the building is supposed to be treated as the refuge area.


# Detailed Requirements for Exits in High-rise Buildings: Fire Escape Chutes and Controlled Lowering Devices



In terms of fire safety, it's crucial that high-rise buildings with a height surpassing 70 meters include fire escape chute shafts for each building wing adjacent to the staircase. These chute shaft walls necessitate a fire resistance duration of four hours. Additionally, one side of the shaft must be positioned at the exterior of the building and be properly ventilated. To ensure sufficient space for evacuations, the dimensions of the shaft must be at least 2.5 meters by 1.5 meters.



Access points to the fire escape chute shaft on every floor must be either from the lobby area or the staircase mid-landing. These access points should have a self-closing door boasting a fire resistance of a minimum of one hour. Furthermore, the fire chutes should be of the staggered type, with the landing of each section not exceeding a vertical height of 21 meters.



As an alternative to the fire escape chutes, high-rise buildings higher than 70 meters can integrate a fire tower at the landing/mid-landing level with a smoke-check lobby. This tower and lobby inclusion should also feature a fireman lift, which is an integral part of the fire escape staircase or fire evacuation lift (Hydro pneumatic/electrically operated). This lift needs to be established on the external face of the building and have an opening within the fire escape staircase at landing/mid-landing level with a smoke-check lobby. Such a setup must be approved by the CFO.



An important note to consider is that both the smoke-check lobby and evacuation lift must possess a positive level difference of at least 75 millimeters relative to the staircase landing or mid-landing level. This requirement is vital to prevent the ingress of water in the fireman lift shaft.


# Detailed Examination of Structural Safety and Services: Comprehensive Overview of Structural Design Standards 



## Analysis of Structural Design Principles:



The process of designing foundations, elements constituted of masonry, timber, plain concrete, reinforced concrete, pre-stressed concrete, and structural steel is mandated by the provisions articulated in the Part VI Structural Design Section1 - Loads, Section 2-Foundation, Section 3-Wood, Section 4- Masonry, Section 5-Concrete, Section 6-Steel, National Building Code of India, and the applicable IS code that is relevant. The guidance refers to these components' structural design in line with the subjected heading and context.



The requirement for structural design to adhere to Indian Standard Codes is apparent. This adherence emanates from the necessity for structural safety, seismic safety, and protection against cyclone/wind storms, as maintained in the document's context. It's also indicated that this must be in conformity with the most recent amendments.



When reflecting on the Indian Standard Code of Practice and its application to Earthquake Resistant Design, it's noteworthy that both IS1893 and IS4326 codes are stipulated within the paragraph relating to structural safety and services.



According to the document's text within the heading of Structural Safety and Services, the Indian Standard Seismic Code of Practice for Seismic Design adheres to the provisions of IS1893 (Part1):2002.



The Indian Standard Code of Practice for Wind Pressure specifies the usage of the code IS:1875 Part 31987. This specification is apparent within the segment under review related to structural safety and service design.



As the document under the heading of Structural Safety and Services underlines, the IS Code, as appropriately issued by the Bureau of Indian Standard, could be made relevant from time to time and should be adhered to.


# Structural Safety and Services: Ensuring Building Protection against Natural Hazards



## The Essential Role of Structural Engineers in Building Safety and Resilience


The responsibility of ensuring the adequacy of structural design and safety lies primarily with the Structural Engineer on Record. This mandate includes both the stipulations mentioned in sub-regulation (1), and execution of work in line with the proposed structural design. The Structural Engineer's role is critical in ensuring structural safety for building against natural hazards.



## Compliance with Structural Design, Safety and Execution is Mandatory


Three key stakeholders must adhere to the structural engineer's directives concerning structural design, safety, and execution of work. These include the building owner/developer, professionals on the job, and engaged contractors. Any failure to comply with the structural engineer's instructions is a serious matter and must be reported to the Commissioner immediately.



## Special Regulations for Development in Natural Hazard-prone Areas


When it comes to the development within natural hazard-prone areas, there are specific requirements to take into consideration. For instance, earth quake prone areas, as demarcated as per IS:1893, cyclone likely regions as per IS:875 part-3, and flood prone zones, as indicated by the Flood Atlas prepared by the Central Water Commission and/or MCGM's Disaster Management Department. All these regions have special requirements for development to ensure additional safety measures, and these are upheld irrespective of the zoning use.



## Certificate Requirement for Completed Buildings 


Every completed building must include a supervision certificate and a completion certificate. This documentation must have an appended certification from the Structural Engineer. The record must confirm that the building's design and construction comply with the established IS:1893-2002 norms, making it resilient to earthquakes. Furthermore, the certification must also affirm that other structural and fire safety protocols have been adhered to.


# Detailed Explanation on Structural Safety and Services: Emphasis on the Quality of Materials and Workmanship



## Adherence to Accepted Standards and Codes for Quality of Materials and Workmanship in Structural Safety and Services


In the realm of structural safety and services, it is crucial to uphold a high standard for the quality of all materials and workmanship. This means aligning with the accepted benchmarks and Indian Standard Specifications and Codes. These principles and rules make up key components of Part V Building Materials and Part-VII Constructional Practices and Safety, as laid out in the National Building Code of India, amended periodically.



## Implementing Proper Construction and Repair Practices According to the Structural Safety and Services Standards


In the process of building or repairing structures such as buildings, roads, and embankments, adherence to structural safety and service protocols is mandated. Accordingly, all burrow pits excavated should be deep and interconnected, thereby facilitating the formation of a drain directed towards the lowest level. Furthermore, these should be appropriately stepped to allow the efficient discharge into a river, stream, channel or drain.



## The Importance of Preventing Water Accumulation in Structural Safety and Services


When it comes to structural safety and services, it's vital to avoid the construction of any isolated burrow pits that could potentially lead to water accumulation. Any such accumulation could potentially create breeding grounds for mosquitoes, threatening public health. Therefore, no individual should initiate the construction of these isolated pits, subtly underlining the intersection of structural safety precautions and public health considerations.


# Detailed Analysis of Structural Safety and Services: Compliance Testing Procedures



## Subsection 49 (4): Compliance Testing for Structural Safety and Services


In circumstances where there is insufficient evidence of compliance with the regulations stipulated for structural safety and services, or when a material, design, or construction method does not conform to these regulations, the Commissioner may necessitate proof of compliance. This could entail conducting tests, adequately in advance, to validate claims for alternative materials, designs, or construction methods. Please note that the Commissioner would require these tests to be carried out by an approved agency at the expense of the owner.



## Test Methods as per Structural Safety and Services Regulations


The test method for each material, design, or construction in question must comply with those specified by these regulations for structural safety and services. If no appropriate test methods are outlined in these regulations, it is the role of the Commissioner to determine the test procedure. Inquiries for testing methods specific to building materials should refer to relevant standards from the National Building Code of India, as published by the Bureau of Indian Standards.



## Test Results Submission in Line With Structural Safety and Services Regulations


The regulations on structural safety and services necessitate that owners submit copies of all relevant test results to the Commissioner. Compliance with this requirement is critical in validating the structural safety and quality of the materials, design, or construction methods implemented.

# Detailed Explanation on Building Services: Planning, Design and Maintenance of Lifts



## Lift Planning and Design


The planning and design of lifts within a building, which includes aspects such as the number, type, and capacity, are largely determined by the building's occupancy rate, the population on each floor based on occupant load, and the overall height of the building. These decisions should align with the regulations set forth in 'Section 5 - Installation of Lifts and Escalators' of the National Building Code of India.



 ## Lift Maintenance


Effective maintenance of lift installations should include regular cleaning, lubrication, adjustment and comprehensive servicing facilitated by authorized and competent individuals. The frequency of these inspections is largely dictated by the type of lift equipment and the intensity of its usage. To ensure that the lift installation is always safe to use, a robust maintenance schedule should be instigated, which has been drawn up in close consultation with the lift manufacturer and is adhered to strictly. 



For optimal record-keeping, a log book should be maintained to register all elements relating to general servicing and inspections. An electrical circuit diagram of the lift, illustrating the operation sequence of various components and parts, should be readily available for consultation by the individuals responsible for maintenance. Replacement of any components should happen when necessary and to the satisfaction of the competent authority, specifically the Lift Inspector, from the Government of Maharashtra. 



In the event that any accidents arise from the operation or maintenance of the lifts, prompt reporting to the competent authority, namely the Lift Inspector of the Government of Maharashtra, is required.


# Chapter 51: Establishment of a Parking Authority under the Jurisdiction of MCGM



The Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM), with the endorsement of the Corporation and in collaboration with the Government of Maharashtra (GoM), is tasked with forming a Parking Authority. This is to be implemented at the MCGM level with the primary objective of planning, overseeing, and managing all facets of on-street and off-street parking, including public parking spaces within the geographical ambit of Greater Mumbai. 



The Parking Authority that is set up will bear several responsibilities. Among these is the obligation to set and announce parking costs, along with penalties, tailored to the diverse areas and zones within the jurisdiction of the MCGM.


# Detailed Interpretation of Terminologies Related to Conservation of Heritage



The term Conservation encompasses all the procedures involved in caring for a place to maintain its historical, architectural, aesthetic, and cultural importance. This care includes but is not limited to preservation, maintenance, restoration, reconstruction, adoption, or a blend of two or more of these aspects.



In the context of Heritage Conservation, Preservation refers to the act of maintaining the integrity of a place in its current state while preventing further decay.



Under the same subject, Restoration is when the present structure of a place is reverted to its previous state by either taking off additions or piecing back together existing pieces.



We define Heritage Site as the land enclosed within the perimeter of a listed heritage building, precinct, or natural area as represented on the corresponding map.



Furthermore, a Natural Heritage Site covers natural locations or precise delineated natural spaces that stand out for their remarkable contribution to the scientific realm, heritage conservation, or natural beauty. This term also involves geological and physiographic formations and well-defined regions that are the habitats of endangered species of fauna and flora. These areas garner significant attention due to their ecological value or relevance to conservation. Lastly, natural heritage sites include physical and biological features or groups of such elements that are of exceptional aesthetic or scientific merit.


# Section 52: Conservation of Heritage - Applicability Details



The regulation discussed in this document, with a prime focus on `Conservation of Heritage`, is emphasized to be applicable specifically to the `heritage list`, a concept which is frequently notified by the `Government of Maharashtra (GoM)`. These notifications are applicable to a range of categories including, but not limited to, `Listed Heritage Buildings`, `Structures`, `Precincts`, and `Sites`. In addition to the current lists, the regulation also remains applicable to any future `draft Heritage List(s)` that can be published by the `Government of Maharashtra` or the `Municipal Commissioner`.



The sentence, This regulation focussed on Conservation of Heritage is applicable to the heritage list notified by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM), clarifies the regulatory jurisdiction of this heritage preservation rule.



The entities under this regulation's supervision include Listed Heritage Buildings, Structures, Precincts, and Sites according to the sentence, The regulation for Conservation of Heritage extends to the Listed Heritage Buildings, Structures, Precincts, and Sites as notified by the Government of Maharashtra (GoM).



Moreover, the clause stating, The Conservation of Heritage regulation also applies to draft Heritage List(s) publishable by the Government of Maharashtra or Municipal Commissioner, explains the policy's applicability to forthcoming heritage lists.


# Section 52: Conservation of Heritage: Restrictions on Development, Redevelopment, and Repairs



This section revolves around the restrictions pertaining to the development, alterations, repair, and restoration concerning graded heritage buildings, buildings in heritage precincts, and heritage sites. These actions should strictly align with the stipulations provided at Section 9 (subsections C & D) of these regulations. 



However, the Commissioner has the authority to override the recommendations of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) in exceptional cases, provided these are justified in written form. The Commissioner's decision in such matters will be considered final.



For religious buildings listed under these parameters, any changes, repairs, additions, alterations, and renovations motivated by religious reasons stipulated in sacred texts or as part of holy practices outlined in religious codes are permissible. These modifications are conditioned on the requirement that they respect the original structure, architecture designs, aesthetics, and other special features. 



Before making a final decision, an important point to remember is that the Commissioner should take into account the recommendations from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee.


# Section 52: Conservation of Heritage - Preparation, Modification, and Approval Process for the List of Heritage Buildings and Heritage Precincts



Under section 52, the Regulations governs the actions within the domain of heritage conservation, specifically in the context of preparing, modifying, modifying, or deleting the list of heritage buildings and heritage precincts. However, this list is not a part of the said Regulations by the virtue of Section 37 of the MR & TP Act 1966. 



This list can be either supplemented by the Commissioner or modified by the Government at their discretion from time to time. It further emphasizes that any proposed changes such as supplementation, alteration, deleting, or modification must involve public participation, by inviting their objections and suggestions which shall be duly considered by the Commissioner and/or the Government of Maharashtra (GoM) prior to their formal announcement in the form of a notification.



The Regulation also provides a provision that any draft list that has been published and is pending for approval from the Government of Maharashtra, is to be considered as a part of the heritage list during the interim period. Furthermore, the provisions of this regulation apply to such draft list until it is formally approved by the Government.


# 52. Conservation of Heritage: Policies on Transferable Development Rights (TDR) in Cases of Loss of Development Rights



Owners or lessees of heritage properties, including buildings, structures, and sites, may be eligible for the grant of a Development Right Certificate (DRC) in terms of Transferable Development Rights (TDR). This becomes relevant when they apply for the conservation, restoration, or preservation of said heritage properties, or if their application for development of the heritage buildings is rejected under the applicable regulation. Instances may also occur when conditions imposed on the permitting of development result in depriving the owner or lessee of any unconsumed Development Rights. 



In determining the extent of TDR permissible, the calculation will involve finding the difference between the Zonal (basic) Floor Space Index (FSI) plus the area of the plot and the utilized Built-Up Area (BUA) of the Heritage structure. 



It should be noted that the granting of TDR is subject to a legal contract between the owner or lessee and the Municipal Corporation of Mumbai (MCGM). The contract stipulates that the owner or lessee is obliged to conserve the heritage building in a manner prescribed and endorsed by the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) and approved by the Municipal Commissioner. In such cases, the potential for developing the plot shall be decreased permanently by the extent of existing BUA of the Structure.



The process of granting TDR can be divided into two stages:



1. After getting the conservation plans for the heritage structure approved, the Municipal Commissioner, based on the recommendations of the MHCC, will grant a certain percentage of the available DRC.



2. Once the owner or lessee obtains a certificate of completion for the conservation of the heritage structure from the appropriate authority and after a recommendation from the MHCC, the Municipal Commissioner will grant an appropriate amount of the residual, or the entire residual DRC.


# Section 52: Conservation of Heritage - Maintaining the Skyline in Heritage Precincts



The respective heritage buildings and precincts that have been listed or included in the published draft shall endeavor, where possible, to preserve the existing skyline within the precinct's boundary. This preservation excludes the incorporation of any new high-rise developments, ensuring that the original value and aesthetic appeal of the said heritage buildings or precincts is not diminished or destroyed.



The developments occurring inside these precincts must align with the respective precinct guidelines. These guidelines are crafted by the Municipal Commissioner in consultation with the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC) or as may be decided by the Municipal Commissioner themselves. It is mandatory to attain government sanction for the implementations proposed within these guidelines.



The MHCC also shoulders the responsibility for creating guidelines for different aspects within the precinct, including display of hoarding, signage, advertisement boards, street furniture, and pavement. These guidelines serve as a crucial regulatory measure in maintaining the integrity and heritage value of the precinct.


# Detailed Analysis of Heritage Conservation: An Emphasis on the Heritage Conservation Fund 



The concept of Heritage Conservation underscores that non-cessed buildings included in the Heritage Conservation list should ideally be repaired or restored by the building owners or lessees themselves. On the contrary, when dealing with cessed buildings within the sphere of Heritage Conservation, the option of getting them repaired or restored is present either through MHADA, the building owner, or even the Cooperative Society involving owners and/or occupiers of the building. 



A significant component to aid repairs and restoration within Heritage Conservation is the proposal for establishing a separate fund. This fund would be conservatively kept at the Commissioner's disposal, seeking counsel from the Heritage Conservation Committee during disbursement of the respective funds. 



In terms of securing provisions for the said fund under the banner of Heritage Conservation, possibilities may arise through the District Planning and Development Council Budget, or any other related budgets. This approach provides financial assistance for repair and restoration tasks, further promoting the mission of Heritage Conservation.


# Conservation of Heritage: Development Plan Reservation



The first subtopic focuses on the concept of Development Plan Reservations. In instances where DP Reservations are present on listed heritage structures and the development of such a site could adversely affect its unique character, the Municipal Commissioner should act on steps to remedy this situation. With the recommendation from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC), the Municipal Commissioner shall commence the process including modification, or deletion, of such reservations. This action will strictly adhere to the due procedure.


# Detailed Analysis of the Conservation of Heritage: Grading the Listed Buildings, Sites and Precincts



The document lists and provides definitions for the various grades of heritage site classification—Grade I, Grade II and Grade III/Precinct. 



Each grade's definition holds a distinct significance. 



Heritage Grade I includes buildings and sites of national or historical importance, notably excellent in architectural style, design, technology, and material usage. These can also pertain to significant historical events, personalities, movements, or institutions, and may include natural sites of heritage value such as waterfronts, creeks, mangroves, hillocks, forestlands, and open spaces. These landmarks are significant entities of the city's landscape. An area within 100 meters periphery or as delineated by the Municipal Commissioner in consultation with MHCC is regarded as the vista of a Grade I structure or entry.



Heritage Grade II involves buildings or precincts with regional or local importance, having special architectural or aesthetic merits, or with cultural or historical value, albeit of a lower degree than Grade I. They act as local landmarks, contributing to the city's image and identity. These properties may reflect the work of master craftsmen, serve as models of proportion and ornamentation, or be designed for particular climates. Additional buildings or structures may be permitted within the open space or compound of these Grade II buildings. Grade II buildings, based on the availability of adequate surrounding open space and unconsumed FSI, are designated as Grade IIB or IIA.



Heritage Grade III involves buildings and precincts essential for the townscape, inspiriting architectural aesthetics or sociological interest, yet not as intensely as Heritage Grade II. These buildings contribute to defining the character of the locality, epitomizing a lifestyle, a particular community or region, or distinguishing themselves through their street line or faÃ§ade setting, or the uniformity of height, width, and scale.



A Heritage Precinct is characterized as an area of heritage value and cultural significance, within a specified boundary that may possess a setting reminiscent of significant urbanscape or townscape attributes.


# 52. Focus on Conservation of Heritage Distinctiveness: Understanding the Grading of Listed Buildings, Sites, and Precincts Based on Their Legacy and Importance



Heritage conservation is meticulously conceived into different categories to ascertain their significance. Under the category 'Heritage Grade  I', there are buildings and sites of national or historical importance that embody excellence in architectural style, design, technology, and material usage. These sites may be associated with epoch-making historical events, notable personalities, significant movements, or institutions. Apart from human-made structures, they may also include natural sites of heritage value like water fronts, hillocks, forestlands, open spaces, etc. These sites are considered the prime landmarks of the City and are located within a 100 m. Perimeter. The precincts or view of these Grade  I heritage structures or sites are delineated meticulously by the Municipal Commissioner after detailed consultations with MHCC.



'Heritage Grade - II' is another grading system that pertains to buildings or precincts of regional or local importance, noted for their special architectural or aesthetic merit. The cultural or historical values they enshrine might be of a lower order compared to that of the Heritage Grade  I. Their significance lies in that they are local landmarks contributing to the city’s image and identity. These edifices may be the work of master craftsmen, models of proportion and ornamentation, and designed specifically to suit the climate. Buildings in this category with abundant surrounding open space and unconsumed FSI are assessed as Grade  IIB, allowing for additional construction within the premises. The other buildings in this category, with no possibility for further addition, are labelled as Grade - IIA.



Another distinct category is 'Heritage Grade - III'. This classification involves a considerable number of buildings and spaces that culturally and historically contribute to the city's heritage. In essence, they highlight the cultural or heritage significance worthy of recognition and conservation. These areas embody a special quality of cohesiveness in terms of mass, scale, style, and architecture among their various elements, creating a unique sense of place and cultural setting.



The prime objective associated with the grading of 'Heritage Grade  I' structures is to ensure their careful conservation due to the immense heritage value they hold. The buildings under 'Heritage Grade  II' should be intelligently conserved to retain their original architectural elegance, while 'Heritage Grade - III' Listed Precincts are prioritised for their unique features and attributes, warranting conservation of their heritage and cultural significance. Any development activities in these Precincts should be sensitive in terms of mass, scale, setting, and should align with their conservation objectives.


# Chapter 52: Conservation of Heritage Buildings and Sites


## Section 9: Grading and Permissible Changes for Listed Buildings, Sites, and Listed Precincts



### Section 9.1: Grade I Listed Buildings



Grade I listed buildings have limited scope for changes. No interventions would be permitted either on the exterior or interior unless it is necessary in the interest of strengthening and prolonging the life of the buildings or any part or features thereof. For this purpose, only essential and minimum changes would be allowed, observing accordance with the original structure. Repairs shall adhere to conservation norms based on proven standards with usage of similar or akin materials. Additional buildings or new interventions in a Grade-I complex will be allowed only if such development does not mar the grandeur, scale, setting, and view of the main Grade-I structure. Hinging on these criteria, the new development should be in harmony with the main heritage structure. For a Grade - I heritage, all development (excluding repairs) within a 100 m. periphery or as may be delineated on plan in the surrounding area/vista will be regulated and controlled, ensuring it does not mar the grandeur or views from the main heritage site.



### Section 9.2: Grade II Listed Buildings



Grade II listed buildings can be further categorized into Grade  II A and Grade  II B. For Grade  II A buildings, in addition to the scope for changes permissible for Grade I, internal changes, adaptive reuse, and in certain circumstances, extension of the building may be generally allowed. But, the extension should not detract from the Grade  II A heritage building concerned or the precinct, especially in terms of height and/or faÃ§ade. External changes may be permitted, subject to strict scrutiny, ensuring the conservation of all special aspects/features of the building concerned. 



### Section 9.3: Grade III Listed Buildings/Precincts



Grade III listed buildings and precincts have the most permit for adaptive changes. External and internal changes and adaptive reuse are generally allowed. Changes can include extensions/additional buildings in the same plot or compound given that the extension/additional building harmonize and do not detract from the existing heritage building / precincts especially in terms of height and/or facade. Sensitive additions, alterations, extensions, interior renovations are permissible but should not alter the overall character of the precinct. The new interventions could be inspired by the original character but it should not be a pastiche/tasteless imitation of it. Essential structural and non-structural repairs will be allowed for structural stability while preserving original architectural features. Reconstruction/redevelopment will be allowed with the permission of the Commissioner.


# Detailed Guidelines on Conservation of Heritage: Grading and Regulations for Listed Buildings/Sites & Listed Precincts



Heritage conservation presents distinct procedures and requirements depending on the heritage grade of the represented monument, building, or precinct. This section delineates the specific regulations and permissions required for each grade.



## Grade-I Heritage Structures 


Development permission for changes to Grade-I heritage structures must be issued by the Commissioner, with due consultation and consideration of the recommendation from the MHCC (Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee). Repairs to existing structures situated within the delineated vista of a Grade-I structure are permissible as per established regulations and policy, without the strict need for an NOC from the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee.



## Grade-II Heritage Structures 


Similar to Grade-I structures, development permission for adjustments to Grade-II heritage edifices also necessitates approval from the Commissioner. This approval should consider the recommendations of the MHCC. Additional buildings in the same plot or compound may be permitted under certain circumstances, as long as they harmonize with and do not detract from the Grade-IIB heritage building(s) or precinct, particularly in terms of height and faÃ§ade. These buildings will be referred to as Grade-II (B).



## Grade-III Heritage Structures and Precincts


In terms of Grade-III heritage structures, minor or structural repairs, periodic maintenance (e.g., waterproofing, roof repairs, existing plumbing, re-plastering, interior renovation, furniture work) may be approved by the Commissioner, in compliance with regulations and policy, without requiring an NOC from the MHCC. The caveat is that these repairs and maintenance works should not impact the building's original faÃ§ade, fenestration pattern, bands, cornices, ornamental features, railings, window grids, and patterns.



With respect to reconstruction or redevelopment of Grade-III heritage buildings, height parameters must be strictly observed. Up to a height of 32 meters is permitted by the Commissioner and exceeding this height requires special permission from the Commissioner. Moreover, before permitting the demolition of a Grade-III listed heritage building, the owner, through an architect, must provide complete documentation of facade elevations, material specifications, detailing, etc., to the Commissioner. This ensures preservation of any special features during the design phase of the new building.


# Detailed Guidelines for Conservation of Heritage: Grading of Listed Buildings, Sites and Precincts 



The operation and implementation of grading and conservation processes related to heritage, specifically listed buildings, sites and precincts, adhere to the following strict guidelines and procedures:



1. Development permission for alterations in listed buildings/sites should be granted strictly by the Commissioner. This should be done in consultation or considering the recommendations of the Mumbai Heritage Conservation Committee (MHCC). This particularly applies to the repairs of existing structures within the demarcated vista of a Grade-I structure. As per standard regulations and policy, these changes do not need to insist on a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the MHCC.



2. The Commissioner has the ultimate authority to grant development permission. This is subject to consideration or consultation with the MHCC's recommendations. 



3. If the height of the proposed development exceeds 32 meters, special approval should be sought from the Commissioner. The Commissioner may consider any existing guidelines regarding listed precincts during this process.



4. However, before permitting the demolition of any precinct building or structure, comprehensive documentation of facades, elevations, material specifications, and detailing should be prepared by the building's owner via an architect. This documentation must be then submitted to the approving authorities along with any proposal for reconstruction or redevelopment. This step ensures that any significant features can be acknowledged when finalizing the design or elevations of the new building. In addition, the external appearance and elevation of the new building should be in harmony with the characteristics of the listed Precinct.


# Detailed Overview of Underground Public Utilities, Conveniences, and Amenities Provision

It is essential to note that these structures are authorized for repairs without any alterations to their original footprint or planning. One critical prohibition is against making additions, alterations, or vertical & horizontal extensions to the existing structures under the pretext of repairs. 



Furthermore, the guidelines for allowing structural or extensive repairs to existing buildings are detailed in Appendix IV of this document. Repairs, as stipulated in these guidelines, should strictly adhere to the standards and conditions outlined therein.


# Construction Permision Approval for Buildings Classified According to Risk Factors



Despite anything included in the respective Authority's Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR), the regulations for Architect/L.S./Engineer building permission approval at commencement, plinth checking, and completion cum occupancy are determined by the Risk Based Classification of Buildings as shown in the following table.



## Risk Based Classification of Buildings



In the context of buildings, the low risk category incorporates buildings on plot areas up to 150 sq.m., according to risk based assessment parameters. The moderate risk category pertains to buildings present on plot areas ranging from 151 sq.m. to 200 sq.m.



When it comes to permissibility in Development Plan Zones, both low and moderate risk categories include the Residential Zone, Commercial zone, and Public-Semi-public Zone.



Plot status for both categories demands the plot to be vacant, conforming to the respective DCPR's Plot Status, Plot Criteria, and permissibility in the mentioned land use zones.



The low and moderate risk types of buildings include Residential and other buildings as per DCPR.



The proposed structures for low risk buildings are Ground Floor (G.F.) or P+1 RCC./Load Bearing. While, moderate risk buildings are designed with G.F.+1 or P+2 RCC./Load Bearing.



Front and side open spaces, along with considerations such as the provision of basements, parking requirements and other prerequisites, should comply with the Development Control and Promotion Regulations for low risk buildings and the Development Control Regulations for moderate risk buildings.



Tree cutting or replantation is not permitted for both low and moderate risk categories.



The experience criteria for Architects/L.S./Engineers regarding self-certification and all approvals entailed in this regulation aligns with Annexure-10 of the respective DCPR, which outlines licensing and qualification of technical personnel. This applies to both low and moderate risk categories.



Necessary NOCs and documents as per the respective DCPR are required for both risk categories.



According to the provision for site inspection and computer-based allocation of inspectors for site inspection, no site inspection is necessary by the Planning Authority at any stage for low risk categories. The approval procedure is to be followed as mentioned in Point No.11, excluding point no 11 (c). For moderate risk categories, site inspection at Plinth level is necessary by the Planning Authority. The approval procedure is to be followed as mentioned in Point No.11, including point no 11(c).



Notwithstanding these factors, a warehouse building of ground + 1 story with a built-up area up to 1500 Sq. mts on a plot area not exceeding 1000 Sq. mts, with a minimum space of 6 mts all around, will fall under the low risk category. It is necessary to comply with conditions 3,4,6,7,8,9 & 10 of the above table, as well as other conditions specified in this regulation. 



## Procedure for Building Permission





# Title: Provisional Approvals of Building Permissions via Fast Track Based on Risk-Based Categorization



The segment discusses the empowerment of the Architect, License Surveyor (L.S.), and Engineer (those registered with Council of Architecture & License Surveyor & Engineer registered with the Planning Authority) to grant provisional approvals via the fast-track method for building proposal plans. These approvals are based on a risk-based categorization system and apply specifically to proposals identified as low-risk and moderate-risk. The provisioning of this approval is subject to certain conditions which are outlined in the following table.



Each row in the subsequent table is to be treated as individual sentences, encapsulating the data within the table headers while being contextually relevant to the main subject matter. The specified characteristics of each data segment provide clarity and differentiation from similar sentences under different headings, emphasizing the particular category or entity in which the specification is related. 



The detailed heading of the markdown output is designed to maintain the keyword emphasis and thus preserve the core meaning and intent of the document. It also serves to ensure that the markdown output is searchable in AI-driven vector searches within the large text corpus.


# Section 60(A): Fast-Track Approvals of Building Permission Based on Risk-Based Categorization



The process of granting building permissions starts with the **Submission of Proposal**. This proposal should comprise of an application under sections 44/69 of the MR&TP Act, 1966, formulated in the format prescribed by the respective Municipal Commissioner, Chief Officer, or Chief Executive Officer. This application must be supplemented with relevant documents and undertakings required for the proposal, as per regulation. These documents, certified and signed by an Architect, Licensed Surveyor (L.S.), or Engineer, should be consistent with the original documents and be in compliance with the requirements of the respective Development Control and Promotion Regulations (DCPR) of the authority.



The initiation of actual construction is marked by the issuance of a **Commencement Certificate (CC)**. This process begins with the submission of the application, followed by the release of a Demand Note, detailing the required payment of Scrutiny Fee, Development Charges, and other related charges based on the proposed plans or drawings. This Demand Note is released by the concerned Engineer of the authority within a 10-day period. Following the deposit of these charges by the owner, Architect, L.S., or Engineer, a provisional approval can be given. This provisional approval comes in the form of a self-certification from the concerned Architect, L.S., or Engineer. It confirms that the proposed building plan strictly aligns with the DCPR.



The concerned party must then submit this self-certified plan to the Authority within a period of 10 days. Subsequent to this submission, a junior officer or junior engineer at the ward level, authorized by the Municipal Commissioner or Municipal Chief Officer, countersigns these plans without any further scrutiny. A Commencement Certificate under Section 45 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966, is subsequently issued within 10 days of receipt of the plan.



For **Moderate Risk building proposals**, the Architect, L.S., or Engineer should apply for a certificate of plinth checking using the prescribed application form. Junior Engineers will conduct the inspection, prepare a report, and upload it within 48 hours. A Plinth checking certificate will be granted within a period of 7 days from application receipt, provided the proposal adheres to the sanctioned plan.


# Section 60(A): Fast Track Building Permission Approvals Based on Risk-Based Categorization



## Overview of Building Completion Certificate Issuance Process 



Upon completion of the work, the respective Architect/L.S./Engineer should issue the building completion certificate and occupation certificate, honoring the DCPR provisions. The completed building or structure should then have two sets of completion plans, the requisite certificate, and all site inspection reports submitted to the concerned authority. The signing of the completion plan and occupancy certificate should be carried out by the relevant engineer, authorized by the Municipal Commissioner, CEO MHADA, or Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA), within a 10-day period, with no need for any scrutiny or site inspections.



## Role and Responsibility of the Architect/L.S./Engineer in Building Approvals



The Architect/L.S./Engineer should overseeing the work to ensure adherence to the approval. They share the responsibility with the owner to confirm land ownership and boundary accuracy. In addition, they, along with the site supervisor and structural engineer appointed for the proposed development, must ensure that all plans comply fully with the Development Control Regulations. Moreover, any necessary changes to the construction must be authorized by the Architect/L.S./Engineer before they are implemented. The concerned Architect/L.S./Engineer hold the authority to modify the plan during construction within the DCR's bounds.



## Frequency of Site Inspection by the Architect/L.S./Engineer



The Architect/L.S./Engineer is responsible for carrying out site inspections at different stages of the construction process. These stages are while submitting the building proposal, upon the ground floor’s completion, and finally when issuing the building completion certificate to the authority. The inspection reports, accompanied by photos or video clips, must be presented within 48 hours from the inspection date. 



Should the Architect/L.S./Engineer change after submitting the application or during the building's construction, the competent authority must immediately be informed. Construction work must be halted until a new Architect/L.S./Engineer is appointed by the owner. The owner's notification regarding the licensee's change is considered final. The appointed licensee can then commence with the project upon receiving the owner's notification. 



## Authorising the Authority


# Building Permission Approvals via Fast Track: Risk-Based Categorization and Exception Handling 



## Guidelines on Authorisation to Authority 



The Planning Authority reserves the right to immediately issue a notice to the owner and/or the licensee upon encountering any deviations or irregularities either during the process or upon completion. This notice implies suspension of further work until all deviations and irregularities are rectified to the satisfaction of the Planning Authority. Only then, the concerned parties will receive an intimation to restart their work. In case of major violations, the Planning Authority possesses the authority to take corrective action against the Architect, L.S., or Engineer, following the Development Control Regulations (DCR) or corresponding Acts and Laws.



As per these regulations, it falls under the purview of the respective Authority's Municipal Commissioner or Chief Officer to prepare common application forms, affidavits, proformas, and other related documents to ensure the smooth implementation of the said regulation.



It is mandatory for the concerned Authorities to integrate the above procedure with the Online Building Permission Management System (BPMS).



## Exceptions to the Procedure



The existence of the above-mentioned Procedure for Building Permission does not restrict the owner, Architect, L.S., or Engineer from obtaining development permission based on the regular provisions enshrined in the DCPR. This stipulation is inapplicable for proposals wishing to secure Development Permission per Type Design Pattern laid out by Government TPS-1813/3200/CR 520/13/UD 13, dated 03/01/2015.


# Detailed Guidelines on Constructing and Maintaining Public Sanitary Convenience (PSC) Blocks or Toilets



The Commissioner-approved construction, maintenance, and public availability of Public Sanitary Convenience (PSC) blocks is an integral facet in the development of Municipal/Government plots reserved or currently utilised for public purposes.



1. One standard for locating PSC blocks has them in spots accessible to the general public.


2. The responsibility for maintaining toilets falls either on the user of the plot or based on the decision of the Commissioner.


3. On plots larger than 4000 sq. m with non-buildable, existing amenities but having POS reservations: The construction guidelines propose two toilets and two urinals each for females and males. It is preferable to construct a washroom each for persons with disabilities and children.


4. In contrast, plots with less than 4000 sq. m area, having non-buildable/POS reservations or an existing amenity: The construction plan recommends building one toilet and two urinals each for females and males. 


5. On buildable plots over 2000 sq. m, in use or reserved as amenities: The expectations include building one toilet and two urinals each for females and males, with a strong recommendation for facilities for persons with disabilities and children. These facilities should be located such that they don't cause discomfort to the plot's occupants and must be kept hygienic as per the Commissioner's directives. PSC blocks should ideally be situated directly off public streets and should be constructed every 3 km, particularly near bus stops along major roads or highways, considering all other requirements for PSC provision.


6. PSC construction on the plot's boundary can ensure accessibility from Public Streets. The minimum shared open space between the primary user's structure and the PSC structure should either be equivalent to the front open space required for the primary user's structure or 3 metres, depending on which is larger. 


7. It is permissible to construct PSCs beyond the Floor Space Index (FSI) to specified extents.


8. It is essential to display the PSC availability conspicuously so that it is easily visible from Public Streets. 


9. Provision for constructing a substation above the PSC can be made as per the Electric Supply Company's requirements, subject to a No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Chief Fire Officer (CFO).


# Detailed Guidelines on Rain Water Harvesting(RWH) for Development and Redevelopment Projects



## General Guidelines for Implementing Rain Water Harvesting (RWH)



Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) arrangements must be provided for developments and redevelopment projects with a plot area of 500 sq. m or more. These arrangements should include one or more RWH structures with at least the specified total capacity outlined in the following information.



The certified professional on record is tasked with confirming whether the constructed RWH structures are in accordance with the specifications detailed below, or any different ones, while ensuring in every instance that the minimum capacity of the RWH system is met.



Moreover, it's imperative the owner or society of every building maintains the RWH structure/system in good condition consistently for water storage intended for non-potable uses or recharging of ground water.



## Consequences for Failure to Comply with RWH Regulations



The authority retains the right to impose a fine of up to Rs.1000/- per annum for every 100 Sq.Mt. of built-up area. This is applicable to the failure of a building's owner to set up or maintain the required Rain Water Harvesting structures as specified by these bye laws. Each failure to provide or maintain RWH structures for the scenarios mentioned above will be treated accordingly.


# Detailed Guide on Rain Water Harvesting(RWH) Practices in a Building Site



Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) within a construction site encompasses the storage or recharging into the ground of rainwater falling on various surfaces such as terraces or any paved or unpaved areas within the site.



## Execution Strategies for Rain Water Harvesting



**Option 1:** The potential rain water harvesting methods may include the use of an open well with a minimum diameter of one meter and minimal depth of six meters. Alternatively, an open well with a minimum diameter of 0.3 meters and a depth of at least two meters at intervals of six meters in the Storm Water Drain can be used. The rainwater should be channeled into these wells after being filtered to remove silt and floating material. Ventilating covers must be fitted on the wells. The harvested water from the open well can subsequently be utilized for non-drinkable domestic purposes like washing, flushing, and garden watering.



**Option 2:** To recharge the ground water, RWH can also be performed through a borewell surrounded by a meter-wide pit. This pit, ideally excavated to at least three meters deep, should be filled again with stone aggregate and sand. The filtered rain water can then be channeled into this refilled pit for ground water recharge.



**Option 3:** An impervious surface or an underground storage tank of needed capacity can be constructed within the open space to store rainwater. The harvested water would then be channeled to this storage tank which is always equipped with ventilating covers and draw-off taps well placed for utilization in domestic washing, gardening, and other purposes. To manage surplus, these tanks need to come with an overflow.



In the aftermath of storage, surplus rain water can be recharged into the ground through percolation pits or trenches, or a combination of both. Depending upon the geomorphological and topographical conditions, the pits may be of 1.20m width, 1.20m length and a depth ranging between 2.00m and 2.50m. The trenches can be of 0.60m width, a length between 2.00m and 6.00m, and depth varying from 1.50m to 2.00m. Terrace water should be directed towards these pits or trenches.



These pits or trenches should be backfilled with filter media consisting of:



1. A 40mm stone aggregate as bottom layer contributing to 50% of the depth.


2. A 20mm stone aggregate as the lower middle layer, making up 20% of the depth.


3. Coarse sand acting as the upper middle layer, constituting another 20% of the depth.


4. A thin layer of fine sand on top.


5. The top 10% of the pits or trenches should be left empty with a splash pad where rooftop water can fall.


6. A brick masonry wall needs to be built on the exposed surface of these pits or trenches and then plastered with cement mortar.


7. The depth of the wall below ground should be such that it prevents loose soil from infiltrating the pits or trenches. The wall should also project at least 15 centimeters above ground.


8. Perforated concrete slabs must cover the pits or trenches.



In addition, if the open space around the building is unpaved, the top layer up to a sufficient depth should be removed and replaced with coarse sand to facilitate rainwater percolation into the ground.


# Detailed Guidelines for Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) and Implementation of Solar Water Heating (SWH) Systems in Various Building Structures



## Criteria for Efficient Rain Water Harvesting (RWH)



For effective drainage, the rooftops of buildings must be constructed in a way that encourages drainage of rainwater using rainwater pipes. These pipes need to be wisely arranged, joined, and affixed to direct the rainwater away from the building, ensuring no dampness in the building's walls or foundations or those of adjacent structures.



The terrace must be connected to either an open well, borewell, storage tank, recharge pit, or trench by HDPE/PVC pipes routed through a filtering medium. To discard the initial washings from the rooftop or terrace catchment that could contain dirt, a valve system needs to be incorporated. Covering all pipe openings with an insect-proof wire net is mandatory to prevent mosquito infestations. For efficient rainwater discharge, at least two rainwater pipes of 100 mm diameter are required for every 100 square meters of roof space.



Site RWH structures correctly to avoid jeopardizing any building or earthwork's stability. Designs should ensure no dampness occurs in any part of the building's walls or foundations or those of neighbouring buildings. The collected or recharged water should be principally used for non-drinking and non-cooking purposes.



In exceptional circumstances where collected rainwater is used for cooking or drinking, a proper filtration system and separate outlet for the first rainwater bypass must be ensured. Disinfectants and water purification arrangements must be in place for such use.



## Special Provisions for Solar Water Heating (SWH) Systems Installation 



Solar Water Heating (SWH) Systems should be part and parcel of buildings such as hospitals, hotels, guest houses, police/army barracks, canteens, laboratories and research institutions, and hostels in schools, colleges, and other institutions.



Installing SWH systems is obligatory in hospitals and hotels, where there is a continuous need for hot water. These systems must come equipped with auxiliary electrical backup.



In Government/SemiGovernment and institutional buildings, it is recommended to use SWH systems if the requirement for hot water isn't continuous or permanent. The application of SWH systems is advised in guest houses, police/army barracks, canteens, laboratories and research institutions, and hostels of schools, colleges, and other institutions.



SWH systems can indeed be installed in any other building. Depending on the specific need for hot water, the installation of an electrical backup in all of the water heating systems is optional. 



A sound suggestion would be to install SWH systems with approximately 100 liters per day capacity on thermosyphon, accompanied by necessary electrical backup in residential buildings like hostels.


# Detailed Guidelines on Rain Water Harvesting (RWH) and Solar Water Heating (SWH) Systems Installation 



RWH and SWH systems are essential for sustainable living and energy use. The following information will elucidate the necessary provisions required to facilitate the installation of SWH systems in various types of new buildings. 



- All new buildings, where SWH installation is intended, must have open sunny roof areas, which are suitable for implementing SWH systems.



- The design of these buildings' roofs should cater to a minimum loading of 50 kg/sq.m for the SWH system installation. 



- The integration of SWH systems into the building design is also feasible. They can be mounted on the parapets or assimilated with the south facing vertical wall of the building. 



- For an effective and year-round efficient usage, the optimal inclination for the solar energy collector is equivalent to the local Latitude of the location, and the collector should face south. However, for winter-based usage, the best inclination of the solar energy  collector would be the Latitude plus 15 degrees south. 



- Incorporated within all such new buildings will be an installed hot water line from the rooftop, as well as insulated distribution pipelines leading to every point where hot water is necessary in the building.



- The capacity of the SWH system must be determined according to the average occupancy of the building. The table given below states the per capita capacity suggestions for various types of buildings:



1. **For Hospitals**, the recommended capacity is 100 litres per day.



2. **For Hotels**, the recommended capacity is 150 litres per day.



3. **For Hostels and similar buildings**, the recommended capacity is 25 litres per day.



4. **For Canteens**, the required capacity will be as needed.



5. **For Laboratory and Research Institutions**, the required capacity will be as needed.



6. **For other buildings**, the required capacity will be as needed.



- For the installation of a solar energy collector, an open area measuring 3 sq. m is needed, as it would supply approximately 100 litres of water daily. It is advised to utilize 60% of the roof area for the system's installation.



- The specification given by the Ministry of Non-Conventional Energy Sources for SWH systems can be used as a guide. For all such solar water heating systems, a Flat Plate Collector conforming to IS 12933 should be utilized.



- The Commissioner holds the power to add to the list of buildings where the installation of SWH systems can be made mandatory.



- There can also be mandates for the installation of solar energy collectors on buildings' terraces to harness solar energy for purposes other than just water heating.



- The construction and installation of the SWH system must conform to IS12976.


# Detailed Guidelines on Waste (Grey) Water Recycling and Reuse



## Regulations and Provisions for Development and Redevelopment



Developments or redevelopments which abide by the regulations stipulated in the notifications of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India, are expected to incorporate systems for waste water recycling and reuse. Likewise, permission for the inclusion of such systems may also be granted to other types of developments. It falls under the responsibility of the professional on record to endorse the intricately drafted scheme dedicated to the recycling and reuse of wastewater.



## Characteristics of the ideal Waste Water Recycling System



The optimum Waste Water Recycling System necessarily includes waste water from sources other than water closets, laundries, and hospitals. Moreover, the system is expected not to instigate the generation of any foul gases or lead to public hazards during its setup and operation. A paramount consideration while designing the waste water recycling system should be the anticipated occupancy load and the seasonal variations in discharge.



## Approach towards the Separation of Waste Water 



The wastewater is to be recycled by setting up a recycling plant. A separate plumbing network is employed to gather waste water from kitchens, bathrooms, washing machines, and dishwashers. This network directs the wastewater to the recycling plants while dedicated underground and overhead tanks are allocated for holding this purpose. The connecting network ought to be coated in purple-blue color. It is significant to note that the recycled waste water system should be consistently maintained in consideration of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) requirements, whenever relevant.  



## Mandates for the Reuse of Waste Water



Reusing treated waste water is allowed solely for gardening, toilet flushing, landscape, irrigation, cooling towers, car washing, etc. but under no circumstances for drinking, bathing, washing clothes, or utensils. The quality of the output water is required to adhere to the non-potable water standards as set by the MPCB. It is also essential for the owner or developer to include a clause in the purchase agreement which clearly mentions the provision of a recycled waste water system in the development and iterates its maintenance requirements in accordance with the MPCB rules, if any.


# Chapter 65: Implementation and Maintenance of Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and Disposal System



The development or redevelopment of plots that fall under the relevant notifications of the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India is mandatory to have provision for a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) and a disposal system. This rule is subject to updates and modifications as per the notifications issued by the government from time to time.



Even developments not specifically mentioned under the MoEF's notification might require or be allowed to install an STP and disposal system. The professional in charge must provide a detailed scheme for the STP and disposal system, which should be officially certified.



The STP construction must adhere to certain specifications. Firstly, the STP must be compactly designed and approved by the competent authority. Secondly, there should not be any foul smell in the STP area or the surrounding environment, ensuring a pleasant habitat.



In terms of operation, the STP should not require continuous supervision and should function effectively with consistent flow. The quality of treated water must meet non-potable standards, which means it can be used for tasks like gardening, flushing toilets, landscaping, irrigation, cooling towers, or washing cars. However, it should not be used for drinking, bathing, washing clothes, or cleaning utensils under any circumstance.



The treated water should be environmentally safe to dispose of whether on land or water. The owner/developer must include a clause in the purchase agreement with the buyer, owner of the premises, organization, society of occupiers, or the society of purchasers stating explicitly that an STP has been installed in the development. This STP is required to be maintained in good condition as per the standards set by the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB).


# Solid Waste Segregation Strategies for Sustainable Buildings



# # Coloured Bin Implementation for Effective Solid Waste Separation


In an effort to facilitate better waste management, all buildings must deploy coloured bins. These receptacles are designed to separate dry waste, which includes paper, plastic, metal, and glass, from wet waste consisting of organic materials. Furthermore, there should be an allocated space for collecting this waste prior to transfer for recycling or disposal. 



# # Guidelines for Hazardous Waste Disposal


In accord with hazardous waste management guidelines defined by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF) under the Government of India, distinct bins should be provided for the safe disposal of hazardous waste. The mentioned hazardous materials include batteries, e-waste, lamps, and medical waste, among other items.



# # In-Situ Wet Waste Treatment Mandate for Property Owners


Ownership or developmental entities, as well as organizations, societies of occupiers or purchasers' societies, must include a clause in the purchase agreement stipulating in-situ wet waste treatment. The clause must affirm that the system will be maintained in an operational state in line with any requirements set forth by the MCGM, if applicable.



# # National Building Code Compliance for Solid Waste Management System 


The designing, planning, and construction, of the Solid Waste Management System must comply with the Indian National Building Code, Part 9 Plumbing Services. This encompasses Section 1- Water Supply, Drainage and Sanitation, including Solid Waste Management Paragraph 6.



# # Biodegradable Waste Treatment Plant Requirement for Large Construction Area


For plots with a total construction area equal to or exceeding 20,000 square meters, a Biodegradable Waste Treatment Plant of the necessary capacity must be constructed and maintained.



# # FSI Exemption for Solid Waste Management System Construction Area 


The construction area for the Solid Waste Management System or Biodegradable waste treatment plant is exempt from Floor Space Index (FSI) calculations. 



# # Mandatory Environmental Consultant Certification for Solid Waste Management Systems


Before the application for Occupation Certificate or Building Completion Certificate, a completion certificate for the Solid Waste Management System or biodegradable waste treatment plant, issued by an accredited Environmental Consultant, must be submitted.


  
# *Following Segment: Tree Plantation Provisions for Enhancing, Conserving, and Preserving the Environment*





# Comprehensive Guidelines on Biodiversity Conservation and Tree Planting in Infrastructure Development



The execution of development on any land parcel should prioritize the preservation of existing trees as much as possible. The primary concern is to prevent unnecessary disruption to the current natural setting.



In cases where trees need to be removed, a policy of twice-the-number strategy will be applied. For every single tree that is to be cut down, two trees should subsequently be planted in its place. This action demonstrates a commitment to ensuring the return of green cover on the developed land.



Every land plot is assigned a tree-plantation requirement based on the size of the plot. The rate of 5 trees per 100 square meters, or fraction of it, is the regulation stipulated for recreational areas within the entire land plot. This standard expects an increase in tree density within recreational spaces for the benefit of visitors and overall ecological balance.



For land plots where subdivision or layout is not a requirement, the tree-plantation rate drops to one tree per 80 square meters, or a part thereof. These smaller plots are still subject to reforestation guidelines, albeit with a lower density.



Tree plantation should be implemented with careful consideration to not obstruct the movement of firefighting vehicles during emergencies. Precautionary measures such as this ensure that safety protocols are not compromised by infrastructure development.



The design of the land plot should also include planting shrubs and grass between the trees situated along the boundary of the plot. This practice creates a continuous green cover that further enhances the overall biodiversity of the land plot.


# Detailed Explanation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules and Regulations



Paragraph: Notwithstanding any content within these regulations, any development within Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas is regulated by the amended Coastal Regulation Zone Notification No.S.O.19(E), sanctioned on 6th January, 2011 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (MoEF), Government of India. This notification is subject to amendments from time to time, wherever applicable. 



Paragraph: Lands that are designated as Natural Area in Development Plan (DP) and are situated on the seaward side of the High Tide Line are subject to certain conditions. Suppose, if there is any modification to the High Tide Line, and as a result, such land ends up falling on the landward side of the modified High Tide Line. In such cases, that particular piece of land will be considered as situated within the zone of the adjoining land, unless that land constitutes a forest, salt pan land, is occupied by mangroves, or constitutes mud flats.


# Detailed Overview of Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Regulation Applicable for Certain Developments



This regulation, which focuses on the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA), has been established under certain circumstances. These particular circumstances are specified according to the provisions of the amended Environmental Impact Assessment Notification No.S.O.1533, dated 14.09.2006. Please note that this regulation and the specific terms within may be subject to change, as modifications may occur from time to time. 



The primary responsibility of adherence to the conditions defined by the NOC/Remarks falls on the shoulders of the development's owner, developer, or project proponent. This obligation includes compliance with all requirements and stipulations articulated in the notice. Although the responsibility may seem broad, it's entirely confined within the context of this Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) regulation.


#  Opting for Certification of Indian Green Building Codes in Energy Efficient Buildings



In the realm of energy efficient buildings, the owner, developer, or project proponent may, at his discretion, choose to abide by the Indian Green Building Code (IGBC) or the Energy Conservation Building Conservation Code (ECBC). This is noted as a strategic decision that depends on individual circumstances or business strategy.



As per the regulations of the Government of India (GOI) or Government of Maharashtra (GOM), the specifications and conditions of appliances or fittings, as required by IGBC or ECBC, may change with time. These changes would be directed by the respective governmental bodies and the owner or developer must adhere to them.



Thus, in the context of energy efficient buildings, compliance with the IGBC or ECBC standards is a decision that needs to be taken by the project owner or developer, keeping in mind the periodic changes that may be introduced by the GOI or GOM.


# Detailed Fire Protection Regulations for High Rise and Special Buildings: Regulation 47



## General Fire Protection Provisions


In Regulation 47, alongside the National Building code of India's fire protection provisions, the Chief Fire Officer may necessitate additional provisions for fire safety and fire-fighting in high-rise and special buildings. The requirement of these provisions hinges on the building's occupancy size and its height.



## Fire-resistant Construction Material Requirements


For load-bearing elements and building parts requiring fire resistance of an hour or more, non-combustible materials are mandated. An allowance may be made for interior finish materials like wall paneling and floor coverings, provided their flame spread and smoke development ratings do not exceed the very low flame spread limit as per IS:1642,1960 (Class I). Ceiling linings must either be non-combustible or made of plasterboard. 



Stairways, staircases, and corridors must be void of combustible materials. Structural components like supports and load-bearing walls should have a fire-resistance rating of 3 hours, with transoms and ceilings maintaining at least a 2-hour fire resistance rating. 



Internal walls and partitions separating corridors from areas on floors used for purposes other than circulation should have a fire resistance of at least one hour. These walls should not have openings, except for doors or delivery hatches providing fire resistance of at least half an hour. Fire sections or fire walls dividing buildings to mitigate fire spread should have a fire resistance rating of at least two hours. 



Building facades excluding windows and doors should comprise non-combustible materials. To impede fire spread between stories, the minimum distance required between the top opening of a lower floor and the sill of the above floor should be 0.9 meters.



## Staircase Enclosure Regulations


The internal enclosing walls of staircases must be constructed using brick or R.C.C, ensuring a fire resistance of not less than two hours. All enclosed staircases should provide access via a ventilated lobby through self-closing doors with half an hour fire resistance. These doors should be designed for single swing, opening in the direction of escape, and fitted with check section door closers.



The floor landing of staircases should be separate from the common corridor. For staircase enclosures on a building's external wall, ventilation should be provided to the atmosphere at each landing or mid-landing.


# Detailed Analysis of Regulation 47: Ventilation, Fire Resistance, and Layout Specifications for Lift Enclosures and Staircases



## Enclosed Staircase Ventilation and Design Requirements



It is mandated by regulation 47 that a permanent vent, equivalent to 5% of the enclosure's cross-sectional area, must be installed on top of the enclosure. Open table sashes on the external wall, at each landing level, must cover an area not less than 0.5 sq. m. The staircase shaft's roof should be at least 1m above the surrounding roof. Glazing or glass bricks are prohibited in any internal enclosing wall of a staircase.



If it's impossible to ventilate the staircase at each landing because it's located at the core of the building, a positive pressure of 5 mm water gauge must be maintained by an electrically operated blower. Moreover, the staircase shaft pressurization mechanism should be configured to run automatically and manually when the automatic fire alarm is triggered.



## Design, Ventilation, and Security Parameters for Lift Enclosures



In the context of lift enclosures, the fire resistance of the walls enclosing the lift shafts must be no less than two hours. It's necessary to have permanent vents at the top, measuring a clear area of not less than 1800 mm (0.2 sq. m.). The lift motor rooms should ideally be situated at the top of the lift shaft and separated from lift shafts, either by the enclosing wall of the shaft or by the motor rooms' floor.



Landing doors in lift enclosures need to open towards the ventilated or pressurized corridor/lobby, and they must have a minimum fire resistance of one hour. The lift bank should not contain more than four lifts. It's required that the fire lift's shaft in a lift bank be separated from each other by a brick masonry or R.C.C. wall with at least two hours of fire resistance. Lift car doors must have a minimum fire resistance duration of one hour.



## Pressurization Requirements for Core Lift Shaft and Lobby



If both the lift shaft and lift lobby are located at the building's core, it's necessary to maintain a positive pressure of 2.5 mm to 3 mm water gauge in the lift lobby. Also, maintain a positive pressure of at least 5 mm water gauge in the lift shaft through an electrically operated blower. The lift shaft and lift lobby pressurization mechanism should be installed to operate both automatically and manually when the automatic fire alarm is activated. It should also include manual operation facilities.



## Building Core Lift Lobby Exit and Lift Machine Room Specifications



Exits from the lift lobby, if located in the core of the building, must be through a self-closing smoke-stop door with a half-hour fire resistance. The lift machine room should be separate, with no other machinery installed therein.



## Communication With the Basement and Layout for the Basement level Lift Lobby



Lifts should not communicate with the basement in general. However, allowing one lift to reach the basement level is permissible, provided the basement level's lift lobby is pressurized and separated from other areas of the basement by a smoke-actuated fire resistance door with two hours of fire resistance. These doors can be held open using an electromagnetic device connected with a smoke detector.



## Regulation 47: Guidelines for External Windows



Further specifications for external windows according to Regulation 47 are yet to be provided.


# Detailed Specifications for External Windows, Fire Lifts, and Basement Ventilation Pursuant to Regulation 47



## Expert Guidelines on Configuring External Windows



As per Regulation 47, the design and functionality of external windows must meet specific standards. The openable area of external windows on any given floor must equal or surpass 2.5% of that floor's overall area. Additionally, locks for the aforementioned windows must integrate a budget lock that aligns with the carriage key type. This type should allow the possibility of unlocking with a fireman's axe tip. 



## Mandatory Specifications for Fire Lifts



According to the norms laid out under Regulation 47, it is vital to adopt several provisions concerning fire lifts. 



- Fire services personnel should be able to reach the upper floors swiftly, necessitating at least one designated lift for their exclusive use during emergencies. This lift should be directly accessible from every dwelling or lettable floor space on each floor.



- The fire lift must have a minimum floor area of 1.4 sq.m with at least one dimension not decreasing beyond 1.12 m. Its loading capacity should not be less than 545 kg, equivalent to an 8-person lift, complete with automatic closing doors. 



- An alternate electric supply from a generator with sufficient capacity should be provisioned, including the building's regular electric supply. Importantly, cables must run a fire-safe route, typically within the lift shaft. In cases of normal electric supply failure, it should automatically switch to the alternate source, that can be manually operated in apartment buildings.



- The fire lift operation must involve a simple toggle or two-button switch located in a glass-fronted box adjoining the lift at the entrance level. This functionality allows the lift to be on care control only or on priority control devices when the switch is activated. Once deactivated, the lift will return to regular operation. This lift can be utilized by occupants under normal circumstances.



- The term 'FIRE LIFT' should be conspicuously displayed in fluorescent paint on the lift landing doors at every floor level.



- Fire lifts should not contain collapsible gates and must have solid doors with at least one hour of fire resistance. The speed of the fire lift should allow it to reach the topmost floor from the ground level within a minute.



## Essential Provisions for Basement Ventilation



Regulation 47 stipulates specific parameters for basement ventilation. Each basement requires individual ventilation. 



- Ventilating vents with an aggregate cross-sectional area equating to not less than 2.5% of the floor area should be evenly distributed around the basement's perimeter. These can take the form of grills, breakable stall boards lights, pavement lights, or shafts.



- Alternatively, an air inlet system might be installed at the basement floor level, with smoke outlets situated at the basement ceiling level. These outlets and inlets can terminate at the ground level, also using stall boards or pavement lights. However, ducts delivering fresh air to the basement floor level must be installed. 



- Stall boards and pavement lights should be easily accessible by Fire Brigade personnel and rescue teams. They should also be clearly marked as 'SMOKE OUTLET' or 'AIR INLET', along with an indication of the area served, displayed at or near the opening.


# Detailed Review of Regulation 47: Staircase and Basement Specifications for Building Safety



## Staircase and Basement Requirements Under Regulation 47



The stairs within basements must satisfy several conditions according to Regulation 47: They should be an enclosed type with a fire resistance of at least two hours. They should be positioned at the periphery of the basement and accessible only at ground level from outside, thereby preventing smoke from any basement fire from reaching the ground or upper floors of the building. They also should connect with the basement via a lobby featuring fire-resistant self-closing doors with at least one-hour fire resistance. If the travel distance surges beyond the values specified in Regulation 47(3)(i) (I & II), extra staircases need to be strategically incorporated.



## Air Ducts and Ventilation Specifications Under Regulation 47



Air intake ducts can support all basement layers, but every basement and compartment should possess distinct smoke outlet duct(s). Regulation 47 also mandates the installation of mechanical extractors for smoke ventilation from lower basement levels. The system should be activated by heat-sensitive detectors or sprinklers and exhibit superior performance to standard models, functioning at temperatures of at least 550 degrees Celsius. A provision for manual start should be included in its design.



## Fire Safety Requirements for Kitchens and Floors in Basements



Regulation 47 prohibits the operation of kitchens using gas fuel in basements. The division of floor space on floors and basements should comply with the provisions stipulated by the National Building Code (N.B.C.).



## Service Duct Requirements Under Regulation 47



The rules of Regulation 47 dictate that service ducts should be wrapped by walls having a fire resistance of no less than two hours. Inspection or access doors should also display the same level of fire resistance. If the duct's cross-sectional area surpasses 1 square meter, it must be sealed wherever it transverses a floor using non-combustible light material. A permanent vent of no less than 460 square cm, or 6.25 cm per 900 square cm of the shaft area, should be installed at the top of the service shaft.



## Refuse Chutes and Chambers Requirements Under Regulation 47



Refuse chutes should have hoppers situated in a well-ventilated location, extending upwards above roof level. The chute needs an enclosure wall made of non-combustible material with a fire resistance of at least two hours, and hoppers shouldn't be placed within the enclosed staircase. Inspection panels and hopper openings require light fitting and metal doors with a minimum one-hour fire resistance. Regulation 47 expressly forbids flap doors and the inclusion of refuse chutes in staircase walls and air conditioning shafts.

The constructed chambers need to offer a fire resistance not less than two hours. For safety purposes, these refuse chambers must be situated at distances safe from exit routes.



## Building Services: Electrical Services Guidelines 



### General Electrical Services Guidelines



In compliance with Regulation 47, there must be a separate duct for the electric distribution cables wiring. It is crucial for the duct to be sealed at each floor with non-combustible materials. These materials should have the same fire resistance as the duct. The duct meant for electric cables should not hold water mains, telephone lines, inter-com lines, gas pipes, or any other service line.



### Circuit and Panel Guidelines 



Separate circuits should be provided directly from the main switch gear panel for water pumps, lifts, staircase and corridor lighting, and blowers for the pressurizing system. These circuits should be laid in separate conduit pipes to prevent the spread of fire from one circuit to another. All master switches controlling essential service circuits need clear labels. 



In regards to panel doors, any opening in the shaft should be equipped with air-tight fire doors that have a minimum fire resistance of two hours. Further, high, medium, and low voltage wiring running in shafts or within false ceilings should run in metal conduits.



### Electrical Service Room Specifications 



An independent and well-ventilated service room should be located on the ground floor with direct access from outside or the corridor. It is designed to terminate the electric supply from the licensees' service and alternative supply cables. The doors provided for this service room need to have a fire resistance of not less than two hours.



If licensees decide to provide meters on the upper floors, there should be a segregation of the licensees' cables from the consumers' cables by a partition within the duct. Also, meter rooms on the upper floors should not open into staircase enclosures but should be directly ventilated outdoors.



### PVC Cables Requirements 



PVC cables need to have additional sheathing or protection achieved by compounds sprayed on post-installation.



## Building Services: Town Gas/ L.P. Gas Supply Pipes Guidelines 



Town gas/L.P. gas supply pipes should run exclusively in shafts. These shafts should be located on external walls, distanced from the staircases. It is crucial to ensure no interconnection between these shafts and the rest of the floors. Gas meters ought to be housed in a suitably constructed metal cupboard placed in a well-ventilated area at the ground level.



## Building Services: Staircase and Corridor Lighting Guidelines



In accordance with Regulation 47, staircase and corridor lighting should be independently connected on separate circuits. They must allow operation by one switch located on the ground floor, easily accessible to firefighting staff at any given time, regardless of the individual control of light points.


# Detailed Guidelines under Regulation 47 for Staircase, Corridor Lighting and Related Electrical Systems



## Staircase and Corridor Lighting under Regulation 47



1. The lighting in the staircase and corridors under Regulation 47 should be connected to an alternate supply as defined in sub-Regulations (4). 


   
2. In assembly and institutional buildings that are less than 32 m, the alternate source of supply can be provided by a battery that's continuously trickle-charged from the electric mains.


   
3. To prevent the lighting in the staircase and corridors from getting connected to two sources of supply simultaneously, double throw switches should be installed.


   
4. A double throw switch should be installed in the service room to terminate the stand-by-supply.


   
5. Emergency lights should be provided in the staircase and corridors for multi-storied high rise and special buildings.


   
## Alternate Sources of Electric Supply under Regulation 47



A stand-by electric generator ought to be installed to provide power to the staircase and corridor lighting circuits, fire lifts, the stand-by fire pump, pressurization fans and blowers, and smoke extraction and damper systems in case the normal electric supply fails. The generator should be capable of handling the starting current of all the machines and circuits stated above simultaneously. However, if the stand-by pumps run on a diesel engine, the generator supply needn't be connected to the stand-by pump.



## Fire Safety Protocol for Transformers as per Regulation 47



Transformers, if housed in the basement, must be placed in the first basement in a separate fire resisting room with a four-hour rating situated at the periphery of the basement. This room should be guarded with carbon dioxide or BCF fixed installation systems. The entrance to this room should have steel doors with a two hours' fire rating. A suitable curb (sili) should be used at the entrance to prevent the flow of oil from a ruptured transformer to other areas of the basement. Direct access to the transformer room should be provided, preferably from outside. The transformer room should be separated from the switch gears' room by a fire resisting wall with a fire resistance of no less than four hours.



The transformer, if housed in the basement, should also be protected by an automatic high-pressure water spray system (emulsifying). Transformers on the ground floor should be isolated from the other parts of the premises by fire resisting walls with four hours' fire resistance. They should not be housed on the upper floors except for the stilt at the upper level & podium if dry type. A tank made of RCC, capable of accommodating the entire oil of the transformers, should be provided at a lower level to collect the oil from the catch-pit during emergencies. The pipe connecting the catch-pit to the tank should be non-combustible and equipped with a flame-arrestor.



## Air-Conditioning Safety as per Regulation 47



Escape routes such as staircases, common corridors, and lift lobbies should not be used as return air passages according to Regulation 47.





# Detailed Guidelines for Air Duct Construction and Installation as per Regulation 47



Per Regulation 47, **the construction of air ducting must be done using substantial gauge metal according to IS-655-1963 Metal Air Ducts (Revised)**. To ensure safety, the openings around the ducts passing through fire-walls or floors should be sealed with fire-resistant materials such as asbestos rope or vermiculite concrete glass wool.



For efficiency, **the usage of metallic ducts is advised for the return air, rather than the space above the false ceiling**. The insulation of the duct system, whether interior or exterior, should consist of non-combustible materials such as glass wool or spun glass with neoprene facing. 



In any area exceeding 750 square meters on an individual floor, segregation is required by a fire-wall. Additionally, **automatic fire dampers for isolation are mandatory where the ducts pass through fire walls**. These fire dampers need to be operationally manual.



The orientation of air ducts should be such that they do not pass through staircase enclosures, ensuring the isolation of those serving floor areas and corridors. Furthermore, the regulation stipulates that **each floor should have separate air handling units and ducts** which should not interconnect with the ducting of any other floors. 



At the inlet of each compartment's fresh air duct and return air duct on every floor, automatic fire dampers should be installed. These dampers must be designed to close by gravity, in the direction of air movement, and to remain tightly closed upon operation of a smoke detector. If an air handling unit serves more than one floor, the requirements above must be met along with the following additions:



- **Provision of automatic fire dampers working on smoke detectors is required for isolating all ducting at every floor from the main riser**.


- The air-handling units of the air-conditioning system must automatically switch off when the automatic fire alarm operates.


- Air filters of air-handling units must be made from non-combustible materials.


- No storage of combustible materials should be allowed in the air handling unit room.


- Inspection panels must be installed in the main trunking to facilitate the cleaning of the duct of accumulated dust and for maintenance access to fire dampers.  



No combustible material must be placed within 15 cm of any duct, unless the duct is safely enclosed and protected with a non-combustible material (glass wool or spun glass with neoprene facing) enclosed and wrapped with aluminum sheeting at least 3.2 mm thick, which does not conduct heat readily. False ceilings, runners, and suspenders must also be of non-combustible material.



# Boiler Room Regulations Under The Indian Boilers Act (section 7)



Boiler rooms should adhere to the Indian Boilers Act, and several additional aspects should be considered when locating a boiler or boiler room. Boilers should not be allowed in a lower basement but **may be installed in basements at the first level and away from escape routes**.


# Detailed Explanation of Regulation 47: Installation of Boilers and Fire Safety Provisions



Under **Regulation 47**, the installation directives demand that the boilers should be placed in a four-hour fire-resisting room located on the basement's periphery. Such provisions involve an integral catchpitch at the room's lowest point.



Access to the fire-resisting room, fitted with the boiler, must be ensured via a composite door featuring a two-hour fire resistance. The aim is to inhibit the uncontrolled spread of fire.



The specified boiler room has to be equipped with both fresh air inlets and smoke exhausts that point directly to the open atmosphere, ensuring maximum safety and efficient combustion.



In the cases of the furnace oil tank accompanying the boiler being stationed in a nearby room, it is mandated to have a separator in the form of four-hour fire resisting walls. Double composite doors, coupled with a kerb of adequate height at the entrance, must be installed to prevent oil from seeping into the boiler room in case a tank rupture situation arises.



Foam inlets are required to be affixed on the building's external walls near ground level. This provision is aimed at facilitating the fire services' use of foam in firefighting scenarios.



## Ensuring Availability of First Aid and Fire-fighting Appliances



According to **Regulation 47**, First-aid fire-fighting equipment should be made available on every floor, inclusive of basements, lift rooms and other areas. This availability needs to be in compliance with IS: 2217-1963 which offers Recommendations for supplying First-Aid Fire Fighting Arrangements in Public Buildings.



The fire-fighting appliances throughout the building must be distributed in line with IS: 2190-1971 Code of Practice for Selection, Installation, and Maintenance of Portable First-Aid Fire Appliances.



## Mandating Fixed Fire-Fighting Installations



**Regulation 47** also prescribes for a building to be safeguarded by the implementation of a wet riser, a wet riser-cum-down corner, automatic sprinkler installation, high-pressure water spray, or foam generating system as delineated in its sub-Regulations (2) to (6).



The installation capacity of the wet riser or riser-cum-down comers with water storage tanks and fire pumps has to match the specifications detailed in the corresponding table of this section of the regulation.


# Detailed requirements for fire-fighting installations in types of building occupancies

The firefighting system must include a water discharge rate of 2400 litres per minute generating a pressure not less than 3.2 kg/cm2 at the highest hydrant. Furthermore, the delivery rate needs to be 900 litres per minute providing pressure not less than 3.2 kg/cm2 at the highest hydrant.



The specifications for buildings that exceed 70 m in height includes a Wet riser cum downcomer with a complete water capacity of 300,000 litres and boost water capacity of 50,000 litres. The water discharge rate should be 2800 litres per minute at a pressure not less than 3.2 kg/cm 2 at the highest hydrant, and a delivery rate of 900 litres per minute at a pressure not less than 3.2 kg/cm2 at the highest hydrant.



For non-residential or special-type buildings up to 15 m in height, no specific firefighting installation is required, but a water storage of 50,000 litres must be maintained.



Regarding buildings taller than 15 m, not exceeding 32 m, and not exceeding 70 m (in case the plot area is either less than or more than 600 sq. m), and buildings taller than 70 m (if the plot area is more than 600 sq. m), they require a Wet riser cum downcomer. The water storage and boosts water capacity, discharge rate, and delivery rate specifications vary based on the building's height, providing specific firefighting water supply guidelines for these four scenarios.



For all the listed categories, one can incorporate an automatic sprinkler or a drencher system, if the associated risk necessitates such protective measures. Additionally, a minimum of two hydrants should be placed within a courtyard.





# Detailed Description of Fire Fighting Installation Requirements



The fire fighting installations, specifically the wet riser-cum-down comer setup, is designed for effective fire management within the building. This system uses vertical rising mains with a minimum internal diameter of 10 cm. On every floor landing, these mains are connected to hydrants and hose reels linked to an overhead water storage tank. This tank aids firefighting operations through a series of components - a booster pump, a check valve, and a non-return valve located near the tank end. Furthermore, a fire pump, gate, and non-return valve over the underground static tank play crucial roles. 



For charging the rising main, a fire service inlet at ground level containing a non-return valve is provided. This inlet is used primarily when the static fire pumps over the underground static tanks fail. Importantly, the performance of these pumps must not exceed an R.P.M. of 2,000. The water stored in these tanks is exclusively reserved for firefighting and must not be diverted for domestic or other uses. CFO or CFO manual-based requirements guide the layout of the underground static water tank.



In buildings over 32 meters high, specifically non-residential ones, the riser size should be 15 cm (internal dia.) featuring twin hydrant outlets and a hose reel on every floor. An addition to the wet riser system is a provision allowing a direct boost of water pressure from the mobile pump. This must be comprised of suitable fire service inlets, a non-return valve, and a gate valve.



With regard to Hose Reel specifications, it is crucial that the internal diameter of the rubber hose for the hose reel is not less than 19 mm. It must also be furnished with a shut-off branch and a nozzle measuring 4.8 mm.



## Fire Hydrant and Hose Reel Installations



Wet Riser Installations must conform to IS: 3644-1966 Code of Practice for Installations of Internal Fire Hydrants in high-rise buildings. Apart from this, the wet riser must be built for zonal distribution to prevent the development of unduly high pressure in risers and hose pipes. 



For buildings rising above 32 m., the wet riser-cum-down comer system and first aid hose reels must adhere to IS:884-1969 Specifications for First Aid Hose Reel for Fire Fighting (Fixed Installation). The first aid hose reel must be connected directly to the wet riser through one of the female couplings of twin couplings of landing valves, when there is a single outlet of the wet riser installations. This can be achieved by using an adapter.

# Detailed Guidelines and Protocols for Repairs to Existing Buildings: Appendix IV (Regulation 60)



Based on the classification described in Appendix IV (Regulation 60), repairs to existing buildings can be categorized into two types:



1. **Partial Repairs**: These are repairs carried out to 75% of the Built-up Area (BUA) of an existing building. Such repairs, which constitute a significant but not complete overhaul of the building, can be permitted with approval from the Commissioner.


2. **Extensive Repairs**: These are defined as any repairs extending beyond the 75% BUA threshold. They necessitate a comprehensive renovation of the building and require special permission from the Commissioner.



Further to this, the nature of the building can be divided into two categories:



1. **Category I**: These buildings are unaffected by road widening or Development Plan (DP) Reservations.


2. **Category II**: These buildings have been impacted by one or multiple factors including road widening, reservations, or both.



A clear sequence of steps has been defined when submitting a repair proposal. The required prerequisites include a Notice under section 342 of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation (MMC) Act and notice under section 44/69 of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning (MR & TP) Act 1966, duly signed by the owner or the No Objection Certificate (NOC) Holder.



Other requirements include an NOC from the Maharashtra Building and Reconstruction Board (if the building is a cessed building), a Structural Audit Report or Statutory Notice issued by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM)/ Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and a visual showcase of the building’s condition through photographs of several facets such as the front roadside view, side view elevation, dangerous portions for repair, existing construction material, rooftop images, and a plan showing the block plan, location, and existing details.



Accountability for the authenticity of the proposed structure lies squarely with the owner or NOC holder.



The established guidelines reflect preference for redevelopment or new development under these Regulations for buildings in dire need of extensive repairs. When this is not possible due to reasons like plot size, shape, disputes, or other circumstances, extensive repairs may be granted.



In cases where buildings are impacted by the road widening process, reparations will be allowed, including setbacks, provided there's a registered commitment to not seek any compensations on account of those repairs. Such structures should be able to relinquish the road setback portion compliant with the established policy whenever the MCGM demands.



The standing committee should be alternatively informed when repairs are permitted within setback/widening of the road portion under section 297(3) of the MMC Act.


# Detailed Guidelines on Repairs and Maintenance for Buildings: Appendix IV, Regulation 60



Buildings situated along already widened roads that require extensive repairs can proceed with repair works in accordance with points 2 and 3 above. It should be noted, however, that these buildings' specific properties, such as their location or legal status, heavily influence the possibility and procedure of these repairs.



Buildings on reserved sites can proceed with repair works unless they are under acquisition. On the other hand, if a reserved site under acquisition needs repairs, they can only be executed with the special permission of the Commissioner. Regardless of the site's status, it is necessary for the No Objection Certificate (NOC) holder or owner to provide a registered undertaking explicitly stating that no compensation will be claimed for the repairs if the property is acquired in the future. This undertaking should clarify that the permission for repairs will not obstruct the acquisition process.



The sole responsibility for preserving the existing tenement, along with maintaining its authorised uses, falls on the owner or the NOC holder of the property. 



Repair works on unauthorised structures, or unauthorised parts of structures, are strictly disallowed according to these guidelines.



In the specific case of cessed properties, Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA) or Mumbai Building Repairs and Reconstruction Board (MBRRB) can conduct repair works on buildings after receiving comments from Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) in conformity with the provisions of the MHADA Act. This entity needs to adhere strictly to the guidelines, including any remarks and observations mentioned therein, during the repair works.



The note section further clarifies some cases:



- Repairs to the portions that do not match the originally approved plan but form part of common amenities, like toilet blocks, washing places, common passages, and staircases, can be scrutinised and authorised at Deputy Chief Engineer (BP)'s level.


  
- If the applicant provides documental evidence from a government authority that confirms the existence of these non-tallying portions prior to 01/04/1962 for non-residential and 17/4/1964 for residential buildings, repairs can be granted.


  
- For properties owned by government, semi-government organisations, Municipal Corporation, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (B.E.S.T.) Undertaking, or Government-Semi Government Undertakings, the decision of the Head of Department/Competent Authority of the concerned organisation suffices for repair approval. However, these entities need to strictly follow a structural audit as commanded by MCGM, ensuring compliance with the directives.

#Advanced Possession Receipt: Transfer Process and Conditions for Property or Land Territories as per DCR 2034 Regulations



The content of this section refers to the process of transfer of advanced possession of properties or territories such as plots, areas of D.P. Road, reservations, or amenity areas. The areas are identified by their respective Survey Numbers, House Numbers, CTS Numbers, C.S. Numbers, Final Plot Numbers, etc. Further identification of these territories is carried out based on their location in specific villages, divisions, and Town Planning Scheme (TPS) numbers in specific wards. 



This specific case involves two parties - an individual designated as Assistant Engineer in the office of Deputy Chief Engineer (Building Permits) and the actual owner of the property in question. The process entailed the Assistant Engineer taking over possession on behalf of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) as per the guidelines outlined in the Development Control Regulations (DCR) 2034. Concurrently, the owner has designated representative possession of the property to the Municipal Corporation.



The possession receipt indicates the transfer and acceptance of the property as mandated by the Deputy Superintendent Land Records in accordance to Indian Registration Act, 1908. However, it should be noted that this is only a preliminary receipt and does not mark the final possession of the property by MCGM. 



The final possession receipt will be issued post-validation of the actual area by means of DCR provisions and a joint measurement plan. The physical transfer of the property possession from the owner to MCGM is also a requirement. The financials pertaining to the transaction are to be undertaken by the owner or lessee.



In the preliminary stage of the process, certain specifics about the property are recorded. These include details such as the Survey Number, House Number, CTS/C.S./F.P. Number, Village/Division/TPS, and the Area in Square Meters.



The process of property transfer involves certain conditions to adhere to before the final possession is granted by the owner. These conditions include the construction of compound wall with gate wherever needed, provision for storm water drain, joint measurement survey with City Survey Officer, title clearance certification by an advocate or solicitor with minimum 10 years of experience, owner agreement to rectify any defects in the works through a separate undertaking, and any other conditions necessary for the general public's interest.



The final handover process involves the original owner handing over the property to the designated SubEngineer/AssistantEngineer, Building Proposal (Ward).



This advanced possession receipt is issued as per Provisions of Regulation Number of DCR 2034, upon request by the applicant. However, this does not grant the land owner/lessee the rights to serve a Purchase Notice under Section 49/127 of Maharashtra Region and Town Planning Act, 1966. This document serves as a disclaimer that the advanced possession receipt is not an acknowledgment of the final possession of the property.


# Detailed Overview of Final Possession Receipt Procedures from Owner to DP & Estate Department by the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai
